<h1 title="">AROUND THE CAMP-FIRE.</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">OFF TO THE SQUATOOKS.&mdash;THE PANTHER AT THE PARSONAGE.&mdash;BEAR VS. BIRCH-BARK.</span></h2>
<p>It was toward the end of July, and Fredericton,
the little New Brunswick capital, had grown
hot beyond endurance, when six devoted canoeists&mdash;Stranion,
Magnus, Queerman, Sam, Ranolf,
and myself&mdash;heard simultaneously the voices of
wild rapids calling to them from afar. The desire
of the woods awoke in us. The vagrant blood
that lurks in the veins of our race sprang up and
refused to be still. The very next day we fled
from the city and starched collars, seeking freedom
and the cool of the wilderness.</p>
<p>It was toward Lake Temiscouata and the wilds
of the Squatooks that we set our eager faces. In
shirt-sleeves and moccasins we went. For convenience
we had our clothes stitched full of pockets.
Our three good birch canoes and our other <i>impedimenta</i>
we put on board a flat-car at the station.
And that same evening found us at the village of
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
Edmundston, where the Madawaska flows into the
St. John at a point about one hundred and fifty
miles above Fredericton.</p>
<p>Unless you are an experienced canoeman, skilled
not only with the paddle but with the pole, and
expert to run the roughest rapids, you should take
a guide with you on the Squatook trip. You
should go in the bow of your canoe, with a trusty
Indian in the stern; one Indian and one canoe for
each man of the party. The art of poling a birch-bark
against a stiff current is no easy one to acquire,
and needs both aptitude and practice. Your
Indian will teach you in the gentler waters; and
the rest of the time you may lounge at your ease,
casting a fly from side to side, and ever climbing
on between the changing shores. But as for us,
we needed no Indians. We were all six masters
of canoe-craft. Each took his turn at the white
spruce pole; and we conquered the currents rejoicing.</p>
<p>Temiscouata is a long, narrow lake just outside
the boundaries of New Brunswick. It lies in the
Province of Quebec; but its outlet is the Madawaska
River, a New Brunswick stream. Our plan
of proceeding was to take to the canoes at Edmundston,
and pole fifteen miles up the Madawaska,
make a portage of five miles across country
to Mud Lake, follow Beardsley Brook, the outlet
of Mud Lake, to its junction with the Squatook
River, and then slip down this swift stream, with
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
its chain of placid expansions, till we should float
out upon the waters of Toledi Lake. Toledi
River would then receive us among its angry
rapids and cascades, to eject us forcibly at last
upon the great bosom of Temiscouata, whence we
should find plain paddling back to Edmundston.
This would make a round trip of, say one hundred
and forty miles; and all of them, save the
first fifteen, with the current.</p>
<p>At Edmundston that evening we pitched our
tent beside the stream; and next morning, though
it was raw and threatening, we made an early
start. In one canoe went Stranion and Queerman;
in the second, Sam and Ranolf; in the third, Magnus
and myself. The bedding, extra clothing,
etc., laced up snugly in squares of oiled canvas,
made luxurious seats, while the eatables were
stowed in light, strong boxes built to fit the
canoes.</p>
<p>The first day out is usually uneventful, and this
was no exception. When adventures are looked
for they pretty certainly fail to arrive. We
reached the portage with an hour of daylight
to spare, and there found an old log cabin, which
saved us the necessity of pitching our tent. It
was dry, well-ventilated, abundantly uncivilized.
What a supper Stranion cooked for us! And
then what a swarm of mosquitoes and midges
flocked in to bid us welcome! We hedged ourselves
about with a cordon of slow fires of cedar
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
bark, the smoke of which proved most distasteful
to them, and almost equally so to us. And then
with a clear blaze crackling before the open door,
and our blankets spread on armfuls of spruce
boughs, we disposed ourselves luxuriously for
pipes and yarns.</p>
<p>Queerman drew a long, blissful whiff through
his corn-cob, blew a succession of rings, and murmured
like a great bumblebee,&mdash;</p>

<p class="t0">To him who is a vagabond.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll tell us the first yarn?&rdquo; inquired Sam,
as his pipe drew freely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stranion begins,&rdquo; said Magnus quietly. Magnus
was a man of few words; but when he opened
his mouth, what he said went. He was apt to do
more and say less than any one else in the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; said Stranion, &ldquo;if Magnus says
so, here goes. What shall I talk about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who ever heard of Stranion talking about
anything but panthers?&rdquo; jeered Ranolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; assented Stranion, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s something
in what you say. The other night I was thinking
over the various adventures which have befallen
me in my devotion to birch and paddle. It surprises
me to find what a lot of scrapes I&rsquo;ve got
into with the panthers. The brutes seem to fairly
haunt me. Of course fellows who every year go
into the Squatook woods are bound to have adventures,
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
more or less. You get cornered maybe by
an old bull-moose, or have a close shave with some
excited bear, or strike an unusually ugly lynx, or
get spilled out of the canoe when you&rsquo;re trying to
run Toledi Falls; but in my case it is a panther
every time. Whenever I go into the woods there is
sure to be one of these creatures sneaking around.
I declare it makes me quite uneasy to think of it,
though I&rsquo;ve always got the best of them so far.
I&rsquo;ll bet you a trout there are one or two spotting
me now from those black thickets on the mountain;
and one of these days, if I don&rsquo;t look sharp,
they&rsquo;ll be getting even with me for all the members
of their family that I have cut off in their sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you go along!&rdquo; exclaimed Sam. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
getting sentimental. I can tell you, I have killed
more trout than you have panthers, and there&rsquo;s no
old patriarch of a trout going to get even with
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam&rsquo;s practical remark went unheeded; and in
a few moments Stranion resumed,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, boys, the beasts began to haunt me
in my very cradle so to speak. Did any of you
ever hear mother tell that story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have!&rdquo; ejaculated Queerman; but the rest
of us hastened to declare our ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Stranion. &ldquo;Queerman shall
see that I stick to the facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, boys, I&rsquo;ve a heavy contract on hand
then,&rdquo; cried Queerman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>But Stranion blandly ignored him, and continued,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call this tale&mdash;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;THE PANTHER AT THE PARSONAGE.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;You have all seen the old parsonage at the
mouth of the Keswick River. That&rsquo;s a historic
edifice for you! Therein was I born. There were
more trees around it then than now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the mature age of ten months I moved
away from that neighborhood, but not before the
Indian devil, as the panther is called in that
region, had found me out and marked me as a
foreordained antagonist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One bright June morning, when I was about
five months old, and not yet able to be much protection
to my young mother, my father set out on
one of his long parochial drives, and we were left
alone,&mdash;no, not quite alone; there was Susan, the
kitchen-girl, for company. That constituted the
garrison of the parsonage on that eventful morning,&mdash;mother,
Susan, and myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot say I <i>remember</i> what took place, but
I have so often been told it that I feel as if I had
taken an active part. Mother and I were sitting
by an open window, down-stairs, looking out on
the front yard, when suddenly mother called out
sharply,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Susan, Susan! Come here and see what sort
of a creature this is coming through the grove!&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;There was a frightened ring in my mother&rsquo;s
voice which brought Susan promptly to her
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just then the &lsquo;creature,&rsquo; which was long and
low and stealthy, reached the garden fence. It
mounted the fence gracefully, and paused to look
about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a horrified gasp, mother caught me to
her bosom, and whispered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a tiger!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No&rsquo;m,&rsquo; cried Susan, &lsquo;it ain&rsquo;t no tiger; but
it&rsquo;s an Injun devil, which is pretty nigh as bad.&rsquo;
And she ran and slammed down the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The noise attracted the brute&rsquo;s attention. He
glanced our way, dropped to the ground, and crept
stealthily toward the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The attic!&rsquo; cried mother wildly. &lsquo;All the
windows down-stairs are wide open.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need hardly assure you, boys, it didn&rsquo;t take
those two women and me very long to get up-stairs.
As we reached the top we heard a crash
in the parlor, and mother nearly squeezed me to
death in her terror for me; but Susan exclaimed
almost gleefully,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I declare, if he ain&rsquo;t got in the wrong winder!
Parlor door&rsquo;s shut!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time we were on the attic stairs; and
the door at the foot of the stairs&mdash;a solid, old-fashioned
country door&mdash;was safely bolted behind
us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;That door was the only means of access to
the attic; and on the head of the stairs we all
sat down to take breath. Then in mother the anxious
housewife began to reappear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What <i>was</i> that the horrid brute broke in the
parlor, Susan?&rsquo; she queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Must a&rsquo; been them dishes on the little table
by the winder, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; responded the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then we heard a clatter again, as the
beast, in springing out of the window, knocked
the fragments of pottery aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few moments he found another entrance.
The soft <i>pat</i>, <i>pat</i> of his great furry feet could be
heard on the lower stairs. He was evidently hungry,
and much puzzled at our sudden disappearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could hear him sniffing around, in and out
of the bedrooms, and at last that soft, persistent
tread found its way to the attic door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How he did sniff about the bottom of that
door till the blood of his prisoners ran cold with
horror! Then he began to scratch, which was
more than they could stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terror lent them invention, and mother put
me into a basket of old clothes, while she helped
Susan drag a heavy bedstead to the head of the
stairs. This bedstead effectually blocked the narrow
stairway, and when they had piled a chest of
drawers on top of it they once more felt secure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this trouble was unneeded, however, as
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
that door, opening outward, was an insurmountable
barrier to the panther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few minutes he stole away restlessly.
Then we heard some flower-pots, which stood on
the window-ledge of the front bedroom, go crash
on the steps below. The Indian devil was getting
out of the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, the attic in which we had taken refuge
was lighted by two windows,&mdash;a small one in the
gable, looking out upon the barnyard, and the
other, a very small skylight, reached by a sort
of fixed step-ladder from the attic floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as mother heard the animal&rsquo;s claws
on the side of the house, she thought of the skylight,
and cried to Susan to shut it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The skylight had an outer shutter of wood,
which was closed in winter-time to keep the
heavy snowfall from breaking the glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This shutter was now thrown back upon the
roof, and the inner sash was raised a few inches
for the sake of ventilation. Susan fairly flew up
the ladder, and pulled out the little stick that
supported the sash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had barely got the hook slipped into the
staple when the panther&rsquo;s round head and big
light eyes appeared within a foot of her face.
She gave a startled shriek, and fell down the
ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this juncture the two women gave themselves
up for lost; and mother, seizing an old
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
curtain-pole, which lay among the attic lumber,
prepared to sell my infant life at a pretty high
figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All escape from the attic was blocked by the
articles they had so carefully wedged into the stairway.
This it would take them some time to clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They never imagined that so fierce a brute as
the panther could be stopped by an ordinary sash
and glass, however strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Indian devil is wary, and this one
was suspicious of the glass. When, on attempting
to put his head down through the skylight, he
met with an obstacle where he did not see any,
he thought he detected a trap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sniffed all over each pane, stopping every
moment to eye us angrily. Then he scratched,
but very gingerly, at the sash, and only tore away
some splinters. The sash was stout and new.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last he thrust his muzzle over roughly
against the pane, and his nose went through the
glass. Susan sank in a heap, while mother, with
deadly purpose, grasped her curtain-pole, expecting
instant attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not to be so, however; for which the
world is much to be congratulated. The panther
cut his nose pretty severely on the broken glass,
and shrank back, snarling viciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was more than ever convinced that the
skylight was a trap, and would not trust his
muzzle again in the opening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;Observing the beast&rsquo;s caution, mother plucked
up new hope. She remembered having read that
lions and tigers were afraid of fire, and forthwith
she hit on a truly brilliant expedient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Get up, Susan,&rsquo; she commanded, &lsquo;and be of
some use. Go and light that lamp on your washstand,
and bring it to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Susan obeyed with alacrity, cheered by the
thought that there was anything left to do. When
the lamp was brought, mother laid the chimney
aside, and turned up the wick so as to give a
flaring, smoky blaze. Then she handed the lamp
back to Susan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Take it,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and set it on the top of
the ladder, right under the broken pane.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was too much for poor Susan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I dasn&rsquo;t&mdash;never!&rsquo; she whimpered, backing
hastily out of her mistress&rsquo;s reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother regarded her with withering scorn,
then turned and looked at me, where I lay close
behind her in a basket of old clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuring herself that the panther could not
get me in her absence, she seized the lamp and
marched up the ladder with it. The panther
growled most menacingly, and thrust his face
down to the opening; but as the smoke and flame
came under his nose, he snarled and drew back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the very topmost step did mother deposit
the lamp, where it blazed right up through the
broken pane. As she turned down the ladder, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
panther&rsquo;s claws were heard along the shingles,
beating a reluctant retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a moment or two he was heard on the shed,
and then mother opened the skylight, reached out,
and clapped down the wooden shutter. Susan&rsquo;s
courage revived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that the danger was over, mother picked
me out of the basket, and gathered me again to
her bosom, while Susan began to speculate on what
the panther would be up to next. On this point
she was not long left in doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the corner of the barnyard was a pig-pen,
inhabited at the time by a pig three months old.
Presently the poor little pig set up a terrific
squealing, and mother and Susan rushed to the
gable window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I have said before, this window commanded
a view of the barnyard. The panther was on the
roof of the pen, peering down through the cracks,
and scratching vigorously to gain an entrance.
Baby had been denied him, but pork he was determined
to have.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pig squealed in a way that mother trusted
would alarm the neighborhood, and tried to hide
himself in the straw from the reach of those pale,
cruel eyes. At last the panther quitted the roof,
and found the pen door. Here he paused a moment
or two, suspecting another trap. Then, finding
nothing suspicious, in he glided. There was
one terrific squeal, and all was still.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy mother and Susan both wept, thinking
how well the fate of poor piggie might have
been their own&mdash;and mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a long while the two women kept watch
at the window. At last the panther reappeared,
walking very lazily, and licking his chops. He
glanced at the house in a good-natured fashion,
as if he bore us no grudge; cleaned his great face
with one paw, sniffed the air thoughtfully in various
directions, and then made off towards the
woods; and we knew that our pig went with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he was well out of sight, mother and
Susan removed the barricades and forsook the
attic. You may be sure they fastened every window,
kept a keen outlook, and went about their
work in fear and trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When my father got home, in the middle of
the afternoon, he heard the story before he could
unharness the horse. Straightway he set out
again, and organized a hunting-party among the
neighbors. The party was armed with all sorts
and conditions of weapons; but it bagged that
panther before sundown, whereby was my mother
much consoled. And now, have I stuck to the
facts?&rdquo; said Stranion, turning to Queerman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To my surprise, you have!&rdquo; responded the
latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; went on Stranion, unruffled, &ldquo;since
the panthers got after me so early, it&rsquo;s not much
cause for wonder if they&rsquo;ve kept it up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>At this moment a strange, unearthly, gurgling
cry broke the night&rsquo;s stillness, and we started
involuntarily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one of mine ancient enemies now,&rdquo;
said Stranion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure to fall foul of him tomorrow,
and one or the other of us will rue the
day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;we all know it won&rsquo;t be
Stranion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story done, I rose and replenished the fire,
while Magnus passed around a tin of hot coffee.
A whippoorwill,&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Threshing the summer dusk</p>
<p class="t0">With his gold flail of song,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>was heard in a hillside thicket, and Queerman
cried,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to him, boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Stranion; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll now give our very
best attention while Sam tells us one of his old
bear stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Sam with an indignant sniff;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you one I never told before, and a true
one at that. Now don&rsquo;t interrupt, for I intend to
do it up in a somewhat literary fashion, to save
the Old Man trouble in writing it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you kindly,&rdquo; said I. I was the official
scribe of the party, and familiarly known as the
Old Man, or simply O. M., for short.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h3>&ldquo;BEAR VS. BIRCH-BARK,&rdquo;</h3>
<p>continued Sam, &ldquo;is the title of my narrative. It
was on the upper waters of the Oromocto River
that the case of Bear <i>vs.</i> Birch-bark was decided.
Thither had Alec Hammond and I betaken ourselves
in our canoe to kill some Oromocto trout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Oromocto is for the most part much less
rapid than other trout rivers of New Brunswick;
in fact, for long distances its current is quite sluggish,
a characteristic finely suited to our indolence
of mood. Paddling quietly, or poling when the
water was swift, we soon left behind us all traces
of civilization. Instead of beautiful open meadow
shores shaded with here and there a mighty elm or
ash, we entered the ruggedest parts of the original
wilderness, where the soil was too barren and
stony to tempt even a squatter, and where the
banks were clothed with dark hemlocks to the
water&rsquo;s edge. Sometimes these sombre woods gave
back a space, and a wild confusion of many kinds
of trees took their place,&mdash;pines, ash, birch, basswood,
larch, and beech, mixed with fallen trunks
and staring white bowlders. Sometimes, again,
in the midst of the most impenetrable forest a
delightful little patch of interval, or dry waterside
meadow, would open up before us, inviting
us to pitch our tent amid its deep, soft grasses.
Scattered through the grass were clumps of tall
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
wild lilies, their orange blossoms glowing amid the
green; and around the stately heads of the wild-parsnips,
which made the air heavy with rich
perfume, fluttered and clung the silver-throated
bobolinks. What wonder we rested when we
came to these wilderness gardens whose possession
there was none to dispute with us! We
found that as a rule we might count upon an
ice-cold brook near by. Wherever such brooks
flowed in, there would be a deep pool, or an eddy
covered with foam-clusters, or a pebbly, musical
rapid, which meant a day of activity for our rods
and reels and flies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day, after such a morning with the trout
as had left our wrists well tired, we were inclined
to give our rods a resting-spell. The afternoon
was sultry and drowsy,&mdash;it was toward the close
of July,&mdash;and Alec&rsquo;s highest ambition was to
take a long siesta in the tent-door, where an overhanging
beech-tree kept off the sun, and a sweet
breeze seemed to have established its headquarters.
There was no wind elsewhere that I could perceive,
yet round our tent a soft breath of it was
wandering all the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my own part I didn&rsquo;t feel like loafing or
lotus-eating. The fever for specimens was upon
me. I have an intermittent passion, as you know,
for the various branches of natural history, and
am given at times to collecting birds and plants
and insects. This afternoon I had visions of gorgeous
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
butterflies, rare feathered fowl, and various
other strangely lovely things thronging my brain,
so I put into the canoe my gauze net and double-barrelled
breech-loader, and set off up stream in a
vague search after some novelty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me confess it, my taste was destined to be
gratified beyond my hopes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above our camping-ground the river for some
distance was swift and deep. Beyond this it
widened out, and became almost as motionless as
a lake. Along these still reaches the shores were
comparatively low, and less heavily wooded, with
here and there a little corner of meadow, a bit of
wet marsh covered with cat-tail flags, or a dense
fragrant thicket of Indian willow. There were
water-lily leaves in broad patches right across the
stream; and the air was gay with green and purple
dragon-flies, which lit on my gunwale, and glittered
in the sun like jewels. There was not even a rustle
of leaves to break the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last, as I noiselessly rounded a low bushy
point, right ahead I saw a splendid blue heron,
which was watching intently for minnows in the
shallow water. He spread his broad wings and
rose instantly. I had just time to let him have
one barrel as he disappeared over a thicket of
alders, flying so low that his long legs swept their
tops. I felt certain I had hit him, for straightway
arose a great crackling and struggling among the
bushes beyond. In my haste I failed to notice
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
that this disturbance was rather too violent to
be proceeding from any wounded bird, unless it
were a dodo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Running my birch ashore alongside of a
mouldering trunk which had fallen with half
its length in the stream, I made my way, gun in
hand, through the underwood, without stopping to
load my empty barrel. There was no sign of blue
herons where my bird was supposed to have fallen;
but to my unlimited astonishment I beheld a black
bear cub making off at his very best speed, badly
scared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At my sudden appearance he gave a curious
bleat of alarm, and redoubled his efforts to escape.
He had little cause for alarm, however, as I did
not want him for a specimen; and had I wanted
him ever so much I could not well have bagged
him with no heavier ammunition than bird-shot.
I was watching his flight with a sort of sympathetic
amusement when, with a most disagreeable
suddenness and completeness, the tables were
turned upon me. In the underbrush behind me
I heard a mighty crashing; and there to my dismay
was the old she-bear, in a fine rage, rushing to
the rescue of her offspring. Considering that the
offspring&rsquo;s peril was not immediate, I thought she
need not have been in such a tremendous hurry.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/img000a.jpg" alt="" width="562" height="800" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;<span class="sc">I Could hear the Animal plunging in Pursuit.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Page 19.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;She had cut off my retreat. She was directly
in the line of my sole refuge, my faithful and tried
birch-bark. There was no time left for meditation.
I darted straight toward the enemy. Undaunted
by this boldness she rose upon her hind-legs
to give me a fitting reception. When almost
within her reach I fired my charge of bird-shot
right in her face, which, not unnaturally, seemed
somewhat to confuse her for a moment. It was a
moment&rsquo;s diversion in my favor. I made the most
of it. I dashed past, and had gained some paces
toward the canoe, when my adversary was again
in full chase, more furious than ever. As I
reached the canoe she sprang upon the other end
of the log, and was almost aboard of me ere I
could seize the paddle and thrust out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunately I had headed down stream, for
the mad brute took to the water without hesitation.
Had the stream been deep I should merely
have laughed at this, but in these shallows it
was no laughing matter. The channel was deep
enough to impede the bear&rsquo;s running, but by no
means to make running impossible. I felt that
the question of speed between us was now a painfully
doubtful one. My back bent to the paddle.
The broad blade flashed through the water with
all the force and swiftness I was master of. Close
behind, though I could not spare time to look
back, I could hear the animal plunging in pursuit,
and I was drenched with the spray of her splashings.
I was a skilful canoeist; I have won many
races; but never was another canoe-race I was so
bent upon winning as this one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;At last, snatching a glance over my shoulder,
I saw that I had gained, though but slightly. It
was well I had, for the tremendous pace was one
which I could keep up no longer. I knew the
deep water was still far ahead, and I knew, too,
the obstinacy and tireless strength of my pursuer.
There was, therefore, a grave uncertainty in my
mind as to whether I could succeed in holding the
lead much longer. I slackened a little, saving my
strength all I could; but the bear at once made
up her lost ground, and my breathing-space was
brief. At a little short of my best, but still at
a killing pace enough, I found I could keep out of
reach. But if a shoal should come in the way, or
a sunken log, or any like obstruction, the game
was up. With this chance in view I had little
leisure for watching my pursuer&rsquo;s progress. I
could hear, however, and feel, quite too much
of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After what seemed an age of this desperate
racing, we came to a part of the stream where I
expected a change in my favor. For a quarter of
a mile I would have a fair current, in a narrower
and deeper channel. Here I gained ground at
once. I relaxed my efforts a good deal, gave my
aching arms a moment&rsquo;s rest, and watched the
angry bear wallowing clumsily after me, able now
neither to run nor swim. This ended the matter,
I fondly imagined, and I drew a long sigh of relief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I was far yet from being out of the wood!
I had begun to &lsquo;holloa&rsquo; too soon! When the
bear saw that I was about to escape she took to
the land, which just here was fairly open and unobstructed;
and to my horror she came bounding
after me, along the water&rsquo;s edge, at a rate which I
could not hope to rival. But in the pause I had
recovered my breath and my strength. I shot onward,
and my antagonist had a hard gallop before
she overhauled me. I could mark now every
bound of her great black form. The sharp chattering
laugh of a kingfisher startled me, and I
noticed the bird fly off down stream indignant.
How I wished I might borrow his wings! Just
then the bear, having got a little in advance of
me, sprang for mid-stream, so sagaciously timing
her effort that had I kept on she must inevitably
have seized or upset me. But it was this I was
on the watch for. In the nick of time I backed
water with all my might, swerved aside, and
darted past close behind her&mdash;so close that I
could have clutched her shaggy hind-quarters.
I had no special reason for attempting this feat,
however, so I sped on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now began a second stretch of shoals.
For the next half-mile it was much the same old
story, save that I had gained a better start. There
was one little variation, however, which came near
making an end of the whole affair. In rounding
a sharp turn I did just what I had been dreading,&mdash;ran
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
aground. It was only on the skirts of a
sloping shoal, and I was off again before I had
time to think; but the distance twixt pursuer and
pursued had grown painfully less in that moment.
I could all but feel the animal&rsquo;s hot breath upon
the back of my neck. The strain was terrible;
but soon I began to take heart again. I thought
to myself that surely I could hold out till clear of
these last shallows; and after that I knew the
shores were such as might be expected to baffle
even this most indomitable of bears. When again
we reached deep water I was paddling a splendid
stroke, and the bear, apparently as fresh and as
wrathful as ever, was floundering along perhaps
two canoe-lengths in the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time the camp was in sight, a good
half-mile off. I saw Alec come lazily out of the
tent, take a glance at the situation, and dart back
again. Gun in hand he re-appeared, and ran up
the shore to meet us. Feeling that now I had
matters pretty well my own way, I waved him
back. So he took his stand on the summit of
a precipitous bluff, and awaited his chance for a
shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as the bear found herself again compelled
to swim, with a snort and a growl she
turned shoreward to repeat her former man&oelig;uvre.
She took the opposite shore to that occupied by
Alec. The banks were steep and crumbly, clothed
along top with bushes and fallen trees and rocks,
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
and a tangle of wild vines. Yet the unwearied
brute managed to overcome these difficulties by
her stupendous strength, and actually outstripped
me once more. It was all she could accomplish,
however; and just as she sprang for the canoe
the edge of the bank gave way beneath her weight,
and in an avalanche of stones and loose earth she
rolled head over heels into the river. I was far
away before she could recover herself. I saw she
was utterly disgusted with the whole thing. She
clambered ashore, and on the top of the bank stood
stupidly gazing after me. Then I laughed and
laughed till my over-strained sides were near
bursting. I could hear peals of mirth from Alec
at his post on the bluff, and was calmed at last
by a fear lest his convulsions might do him some
injury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reaching the landing-place, I only waited to
pull the canoe&rsquo;s nose up onto the grass, then threw
myself down quite exhausted. A moment later
the bear gave herself a mighty shaking, and, accepting
her defeat, moved sullenly back up
stream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Sam concluded, Stranion rose and gravely
shook him by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I congratulate you on winning your case!&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;And now, being first night out, let&rsquo;s
all turn in, or we&rsquo;ll be fagged to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is hard to get to sleep the first night in camp,
and I was awake for an hour after all the rest
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
were snoring. I lay listening to the soft confusion
of night sounds, till at last the liquid gabble
of a shallow below the camp faded into an echo of
cathedral bells; and while I was yet wondering at
the change, I found the morning sun in my face,
and saw Stranion holding out a tin of hot coffee.
I sprang up, and found myself the laggard of the
crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to breakfast,&rdquo; cried Stranion. &ldquo;Lynch
is here, and it&rsquo;s time we were over the portage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom Lynch was a lumberman whom we had
engaged by letter to come with his team and
drag, and haul our canoes over to Mud Lake.
His team was a yoke of half-wild brindle steers.
The portage was five miles long, the way an unvarying
succession of ruts, mud-holes, and stumps,
and Mr. Lynch&rsquo;s vocabulary, like his temper, was
exceedingly vivacious. Yet the journey was accomplished
by the middle of the afternoon, and
with no bones broken. The flies and mosquitoes
were swarming, but we inflicted upon them a
crushing defeat by the potent aid of &ldquo;slitheroo.&rdquo;
This magic fluid consists of Stockholm tar and
tallow spiced with pennyroyal, and boiled to about
the consistency of treacle. It will almost keep a
grizzly at bay.</p>
<p>By half-past three in the afternoon we were
launched upon the unenchanting bosom of Mud
Lake, a pond perhaps three miles in circumference,
weedy, and swarming with leeches. It hardly
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
exceeds two feet in apparent depth, but its bottom
is a fathomless slime, stirred up vilely at every
dip of the paddle. Its low, marshy shores, fringed
here and there with dead bushes and tall, charred
trunks, afforded us but one little bit of beauty,&mdash;the
green and living corner where Beardsley
Brook flows out. At this season the brook was
very shallow, so that we had often to wade beside
the canoes and ease them over the shallows. And
now Sam did a heroic thing. He volunteered to
let the rest of us do the work, while he waded on
ahead to catch some trout for supper.</p>
<p>It was by no means unpleasant wading down
this bright and rippling stream, whose banks were
lovely with overhanging trees through which the
sunlight came deliciously tempered. Time slipped
by as sweetly as the stream. But a little surprise
was in store for us. We were descending a beautiful
alder-fringed reach, when around a bend below
us appeared Sam with undignified impetuosity.
He struggled toward us knee-deep in the current,
dashing up the spray before him, his eyes as wide
as saucers. &ldquo;A bear! A bear!&rdquo; he gasped; and
hurling down his rod and fish in the canoe he
seized a heavy revolver. We had grasped our
weapons precipitately, and halted. But Sam urged
us on, leading the way. As thus full-armed we
pressed forward down stream, he told us in a
suppressed voice how, as he angled and meditated,
and there was no sound save the hushed tumult
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
of a little rapid or the recurrent swish of his line,
suddenly from the bank behind him rose the
angry, blatant growl which he knew for the utterance
of a she-bear with cubs. At this he had felt
indignant and startled; and, with a terrific yell,
had hurled a stone into the bushes as a hint that
he was a bad man and not to be trifled with.
Thereupon had arisen a roar which put his yell
to shame. The undergrowth had rocked and
crashed with the swift approach of the monster;
and, filled with penitential misgivings, he had
made haste to flee. When we reached the scene
of the possible tragedy, however, the bear, or
bears, had disappeared. We grieved not greatly
for their absence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">THE CAMP ON BEARDSLEY BROOK.</span></h2>
<p>By this time the stream, having taken in two
or three small tributaries, had grown deep enough
to float us in comfort. A little before dusk we
reached a spot where some previous party had
encamped, and had left behind a goodly store of
elastic hemlock boughs for bedding. We took the
hint and pitched tent.</p>
<p>Sam&rsquo;s trout were a dainty item on our bill of
fare that night. Our camp was in a dry but
gloomy grove, and we piled the camp-fire high.
When the pipes were well going, I remarked,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time Magnus gave us a story now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear! Hear!&rdquo; cried every one but Magnus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of your own adventures, Magnus,&rdquo; urged
Queerman. &ldquo;Be content to be your own hero
for once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you a story my uncle told me,&rdquo; said
Magnus with a quiet smile. &ldquo;And the O. M. can
enter it in his note-book as&mdash;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;A TIGER&rsquo;S PLAYTHING.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;My uncle, Colonel Jack Anderson, a retired
officer of the English army, was a reticent man.
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
He had never explained to me the cause of a
certain long red scar, which, starting from the
grizzled locks behind his ear, ran diagonally down
his ruddy neck, and was lost beneath his ever-immaculate
shirt-collar. But one night an accidental
circumstance led him to tell the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were sitting coseyly over his study fire,
when his cat came stalking in with sanguinary
elation, holding a mouse in her mouth. She stood
growling beside my chair till I applauded her and
patted her for her prowess. Then she withdrew
to the middle of the room, and began to play with
her half-dazed victim, till Colonel Jack got up and
gently put her outside in order to conclude the
exhibition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On his return my uncle surprised me by remarking
that he could not look without a shudder
upon a cat tormenting a mouse. As I knew that
he had looked quite calmly, on occasion, into the
cannon&rsquo;s mouth, I asked for an explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you see this?&rsquo; asked the colonel, touching
the scar with his lean, brown finger. I nodded
attentively, whereupon he began his story:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In India once I went out on a hot, dusty
plain near the Ganges, with my rifle and one native
servant, to see what I could shoot. It was
a dismal place. Here and there were clumps of
tall grass and bamboos, with now and then a
tamarisk-tree. Parrots screamed in the trees,
and the startled caw of some Indian crows made
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
me pause and look around to see what had disturbed
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The crows almost at once settled down
again into silence; and as I saw no sign of danger,
I went on carelessly. I was alone, for I had sent
back my servant to find my match-box, which I
had left at the place of my last halt; but I had
no apprehensions, for I was near the post, and the
district was one from which, as was supposed, the
tigers had been cleared out some years before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just as I was musing upon this fact, with
a tinge of regret because I had come too late to
have a hand in the clearance, I was crushed to the
ground by a huge mass which seemed to have
been hurled upon me from behind. My head felt
as if it had been dashed with icy or scalding water,
and then everything turned black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If I was stunned by the shock, it was only
for an instant. When I opened my eyes I was
lying with my face in the sand. Not knowing
where I was or what had happened, I started to
rise, when instantly a huge paw turned me over
on my back, and I saw the great yellow-green
eyes of a tiger looking down upon me through
their narrow black slits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I did not feel horror-stricken; in fact, so far
as I can remember, I felt only a dim sense of resignation
to the inevitable. I also remember that
I noticed with curious interest that the animal
looked rather gratified than ferocious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how long I lay there, stupidly
gazing up into the brute&rsquo;s eyes; but presently I
made a movement to sit up, and then I saw that
I still held my rifle in my hand. While I was
looking at the weapon, with a vague, harassing
sense that there was something I ought to do with
it, the tiger picked me up by the left shoulder
and made off with me into the jungle; and still
I clung to the rifle, though I had forgotten what
use I should put it to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The grip of the tiger&rsquo;s teeth upon my shoulder
I felt but numbly; and yet, as I found afterwards,
it was so far from gentle as to have
shattered the bone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Having carried me perhaps half a mile, the
brute dropped me, and raising her head uttered
a peculiar, soft cry. Two cubs appeared at once
in answer to the summons, and bounded up to
meet her. At the first glimpse of me, however,
they sheered off in alarm; and their dam had to
coax them for some minutes, rolling me over softly
with her paw, or picking me up and laying me
down in front of them, before she could convince
them that I was harmless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At last the youngsters suffered themselves to
be persuaded. They threw themselves upon me
with eager though not very dangerous ferocity,
and began to maul and worry me. Their claws
and teeth seemed to awaken me for the first time
to a sense of pain. I threw off the snarling little
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
animals roughly, and started to crawl away. In
vain the cubs tried to hold me. The mother lay
watching the game with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Instinctively I crept toward a tree, and little
by little the desire for escape began to stir in my
dazed brain. When I was within a foot or two of
the tree the tiger made a great bound, seized me
in her jaws, and carried me back to the spot
whence I had started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Why,&rdquo;&rsquo; thought I to myself, &lsquo;&ldquo;this is just
exactly the way a cat plays with a mouse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At the same moment a cloud seemed to roll
off my brain. No words of mine, my boy, can
describe the measureless and sickening horror of
that moment, when realization was thus suddenly
flashed upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At the shock my rifle slipped from my relaxing
fingers; but I recovered it desperately,
with a sensation as if I had been falling over a
precipice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I knew now what I wanted to do with it.
The suddenness of my gesture, however, appeared
to warn the tiger that I had yet a little too much
life in me. She growled and shook me roughly.
I took the hint, you may be sure, and resumed my
former attitude of stupidity; but my faculties
were now alert enough, and at the cruelest tension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Again the cubs began mauling me. I repelled
them gently, at the same time looking to
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
my rifle. I saw that there was a cartridge ready
to be projected into the chamber. I remembered
that the magazine was not more than half empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I started once more to crawl away, with the
cubs snarling over me and trying to hold me;
and it was at this point I realized that my left
shoulder was broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Having crawled four or five feet, I let the
cubs turn me about, whereupon I crawled back toward
the old tiger, who lay blinking and actually
purring. It was plain that she had made a good
meal not long before, and was, therefore, in no
hurry to despatch me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Within about three feet of the beast&rsquo;s striped
foreshoulder I stopped and fell over on my side,
as if all but exhausted. My rifle-barrel rested on
a little tussock. The beast moved her head to
watch me, but evidently considered me past all
possibility of escape, for her eyes rested as much
upon her cubs as upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The creatures were tearing at my legs, but in
this supreme moment I never thought of them. I
had now thoroughly regained my self-control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Laboriously, very deliberately, I got my sight,
and covered a spot right behind the old tigress&rsquo;s
foreshoulder, low down. From the position I was
in, I knew this would carry the bullet diagonally
upward through the heart. I should have preferred
to put a bullet in the brain, but in my disabled
condition and awkward posture I could not
safely try it.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/img001.jpg" alt="" width="569" height="800" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Laboriously, very Deliberately, I got My Sight.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Page 32.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just as I was ready, one of the cubs got in
the way, and my heart sank. The old tiger gave
the cub a playful cuff, which sent it rolling to one
side. The next instant I pulled the trigger&mdash;and
my heart stood still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My aim had not wavered a hair&rsquo;s breadth.
The snap of the rifle was mingled with a fierce
yell from the tiger; and the long, barred body
straightened itself up into the air, and fell over
almost on top of me. The cubs sheered off in
great consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I sat up and drew a long breath of thankful
relief. The tiger lay beside me, stone dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was too weak to walk at once, so I leaned
against the body of my vanquished foe and rested.
My shoulder was by this time setting up an anguish
that made me think little of my other injuries.
Nevertheless, the scene about me took on
a glow of exquisite color. So great was the reaction
that the very sunlight seemed transfigured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know I fairly smiled as I rapped the cubs
on the mouth with my rifle-barrel. I felt no inclination
to shoot the youngsters, but I would
have no more of their over-ardent attentions.
The animals soon realized this, and lay down in
the sand beyond my reach, evidently waiting for
their mother to reduce me to proper submission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I must have lain there half an hour, and my
elation was rapidly subsiding before the agony in
my shoulder, when at last my man, Gunjeet, appeared,
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
tracking the tiger&rsquo;s traces with stealthy
caution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He had not waited to go for help, but had
followed up the beast without delay, vowing to
save me or avenge me ere he slept. His delight
was so sincere, and his courage in tracking the
tiger alone was so unquestionable, that I doubled
his wages on the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The cubs, on his approach, had run off into
covert, so we set out at once for the post. When
I got there I was in a raging fever which, with
my wounds, kept me laid up for three months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;On my recovery I found that Gunjeet had
gone the next day and captured the two cubs,
which he had sent down the river to Benares,
while the skin of the old tiger was spread luxuriously
on my lounge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So you will not wonder,&rsquo; concluded the colonel,
&lsquo;that the sight of a cat playing with a mouse
has become somewhat distasteful to me since that
experience, I have acquired so keen a sympathy
for the mouse!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">While Magnus was speaking, a heavy rain had
begun. It had little by little beaten down our
fire; and now, as the wind was abroad in the
hemlocks and the forest world was gloomy, we
laced the tent-doors and lit our candles. It was
announced by some one that Queerman&rsquo;s turn was
come to speak. He grumbled an acquiescence,
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
and then dreamed a while; and in the expectant
stillness the rush of rain, the clamor of currents,
and the lonely murmur of the tree-tops, crept into
our very souls. We thought of the sea; and when
Queerman spoke, there was a vibration in his voice
as of changing tides and the awe of mighty shores.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magnus,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;your tale was most dusty
and hot, though not <i>too</i> dusty, if I may be allowed
to say so. It was of the earth earthy; mine shall
be of the water watery. It may be entered in the
O. M.&rsquo;s log as&mdash;</p>
<h3>&ldquo;A FIGHT WITH THE HOUNDS OF THE SEA.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;It was just before daybreak on a dewy June
morning of 1887, when a party of four set out to
drift for shad. There was the rector (whom you
know), my cousin B&mdash;&mdash; (whom you don&rsquo;t know),
and myself (whom you think you know). We
went to learn how the business of drifting was conducted.
There was also the old fisherman, Chris,
the owner of the shad-boat. He went for fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the time the long fathoms of brown net
were unwound from the great creaking reel and
coiled in the stern of the boat, the tide had turned,
and a current had begun to set outward from the
little creek in which our boat was moored. Our
rusty mainsail was soon hoisted to catch the gentle
catspaws from the shore, and we were underway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A word of explanation here. The shad-fishing
of the Bay of Fundy is carried on, for the most
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
part, by &lsquo;drifting.&rsquo; The boats employed are
roomy, heavy, single-masted craft, with a &lsquo;cuddy,&rsquo;
or forward cabin, in which two men may sleep
with comfort. These craft, when loaded, draw
several feet of water, and are hard to float off
when they chance to run aground. They carry a
deep keel, and are stanch sea-boats&mdash;as all boats
need to be that navigate the rude waters of Fundy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we had gained a few cable-lengths from
shore the breeze freshened slightly. It was a mere
zephyr, but it drove the boat too fast for us to pay
out the net. We furled the sail, and thrust the
boat along slowly with our heavy sweeps, while
Chris paid out the net over the stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These Fundy boats sometimes stay out several
tides, making a haul with each tide; but it was
our intention merely to drift out with this ebb, and
return by the next flood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was slow work for a while. We ate, told
stories, speculated as to how many fish were entangling
themselves in our meshes, and at about
nine o&rsquo;clock appealed to Chris to haul in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tremendous tide had drifted us in five
hours over twenty miles. We decided to run the
boat into the mouth of a small river on our right
to take a good swim before we started on the
return trip. The plan was accepted by Chris, and
we set ourselves to haul in the net.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the centre of the boat stood two huge tubs,
into which we threw the silvery shad as we took
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
them from the meshes. When we found a stray
skate, squid, or sculpin, we returned it to its native
element; but a small salmon we welcomed as
a special prize, and laid it away in a wrapping of
sail-cloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The catch proved to be rather a light one,
though Chris averred it was as good as any he had
made that year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, what has become of the shad?&rsquo; asked
the rector. &lsquo;It seems to me that in former years
one could sometimes fill these tubs in a single
trip.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ay, ay,&rsquo; growled Chris, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s true enough,
sir! But the fishin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t now what it used to be;
and it&rsquo;s all along o&rsquo; them blamed dogfish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do the dogfish have to do with it?&rsquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do with it!&rsquo; answered Chris. &lsquo;Why, they
eat &rsquo;em. They eat everything they kin clap ther
eye onto. They&rsquo;re thicker&rsquo;n bees in these here
waters the last year er two back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They are a kind of small shark, I believe?&rsquo;
put in the rector in a tone of inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I reckon as how they be. An&rsquo; they&rsquo;re
worse nor any other kind as I&rsquo;ve heern tell of,
because they kinder hunt in packs like, an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;
ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to escape them, once they git onto it.
I&rsquo;ve caught &rsquo;em nigh onto four foot long, but
mostly they run from two to three foot. They&rsquo;re
spry, I tell you, an&rsquo; with a mouth onto &rsquo;em like
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
a fox-trap. They&rsquo;re the worst varmin that swims;
an&rsquo; good fer nothin&rsquo; but to make ile out of ther
livers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard them called the &ldquo;hounds of the
sea,&rdquo;&rsquo; said B&mdash;&mdash;. &lsquo;Are they bold enough to
attack a man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They&rsquo;d attack an elephant, if they could git
him in the water. An&rsquo; they&rsquo;d eat him too,&rsquo; said
Chris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I hope they won&rsquo;t put in an appearance
while we&rsquo;re taking our swim,&rsquo; remarked, the rector.
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think we had better swim far out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time we were near the mouth of the
stream, a broad, shallow estuary three or four
hundred yards wide. In the middle was a gravelly
shoal which was barely uncovered at low water,
and was then marked by a line of seaweed and
small stones. We bore up the northern channel,
and saw that the shores were stony and likely to
afford us a firm landing; but the channel was unfamiliar
to Chris, and suddenly, with a soft thud,
we found ourselves aground in a mud-bank, a hundred
yards from shore. The tide had yet a few
inches to fall, and we knew that we were fast for
an hour or so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we had got ourselves out of our clothes,
the surface of the shoal in mid-channel was bare.
It was about fifty yards from the boat, and we
decided to swim over to it and look for anemones
and starfish. B&mdash;&mdash;, who was an indifferent
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
swimmer, took an oar along with him to rest on
if he should get tired. We laughed at him for
the precaution as the distance was so short; but
he retorted,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If any of those sea-dogs should turn up,
you&rsquo;ll find that said oar will come in pretty
handy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water was of a delicious temperature; and
we swam, floated, and basked in a leisurely fashion.
When we had reached the bar the tide was
about to turn. The Fundy tides may be said to
have practically no slack; they have to travel so
fast and so far that they waste no time in idleness.
We hailed Chris, whom we had left in the boat,
and told him the tide had turned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chris rose from his lounging attitude in the
stern, and took a look at the water. The next
moment he was on his feet, yelling, &lsquo;All aboard!
all aboard! Here&rsquo;s the dogfish a-comin&rsquo;!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;B&mdash;&mdash; and I took the water at once, but the
rector stopped us. &lsquo;Back!&rsquo; he commanded.
&lsquo;They&rsquo;re upon us already, and our only chance
is here in the shoal water till Chris can get the
boat over to us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even as he spoke we noted some small black
fins cutting the water between the boat and our
shoal. We turned back with alacrity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing Chris did was to empty both
barrels of my fowling-piece among the advancing
fins. At once a great turmoil ensued, caused by
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
the struggles of two or three wounded dogfish.
The next moment their struggles were brought to
an end. Their companions tore them to pieces
in a twinkling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rector shouted to Chris to try to throw
us the boat-hook. It was a long throw, but Chris&rsquo;s
sinews rose to the emergency, and the boat-hook
landed nearly at our feet. The boat-hook was
followed by a broken gaff, which struck the sand
at the farther side of the shoal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile between us and the boat the water
had become alive with dogfish. Our shoal sloped
so abruptly that already they could swim up to
within two or three feet of us. We knew that the
tide would soon bring them upon us, and we
turned cold as we thought what our fate would
be unless Chris could reach us in time. Then the
battle began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;B&mdash;&mdash; and I, with our awkward weapons, managed
to stun a couple of our assailants. The
rector&rsquo;s boat-hook did more deadly execution; it
tore the throat out of the first fish it struck. At
once the pack scented their comrade&rsquo;s blood,
darted on the wounded fish, devoured it, and
crowded after us for more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our blows with the oar and gaff served temporarily
to disable our assailants, but not gash
their tough skin. But the moment blood was
started on one of our enemies his comrades finished
the work for us. Almost every stroke of
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
the boat-hook tore a fish, which straightway became
food for its fellows. The most I could do
with my gaff was to tap a dogfish on the head
when I could, and stun him for a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During these exciting minutes the tide was
rising with terrible speed. The water that now
came washing over our toes was a lather of foam
and blood, through which sharp, dark fins and
long keen bodies darted and crowded and snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly one fish, fiercer than the rest, made
a dart at B&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s leg, and its sharp snout just
grazed his skin, causing him to yell with horror.
We tried to get our feet out of the water by standing
on the highest stones we could find. Our
arms were weary from wielding the oar and the
gaff, but the rector&rsquo;s boat-hook kept up its deadly
lunges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chris had been firing among our assailants;
but now, beholding our strait, he threw down the
gun, and strained furiously upon his one oar in the
endeavor to shove off the boat. She would not
budge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Boys, brace up! brace up!&rsquo; cried the rector.
&lsquo;She&rsquo;ll float in another minute or two. We can
give these chaps all they want.&rsquo; As he spoke, his
boat-hook ripped another fish open. He had
caught the knack of so using his weapon that he
raked his opponents from underneath without
wasting an ounce of effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fight was getting too hot to last. A big
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
fish, with a most appalling array of fangs, snatched
at my foot. Just in time I thrust the broken end
of the gaff through his throat and turned him on
his back. His neighbors took charge of him, and
he vanished in bloody fragments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I watched this an idea struck me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Chris!&rsquo; I yelled, &lsquo;the shad! the shad!
Throw them overboard, a dozen at a time!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Splendid!&rsquo; cried the rector; and B&mdash;&mdash;
panted approvingly, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the talk! That&rsquo;ll
call &rsquo;em off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down came his oar with fresh vigor upon
the head of a dogfish, which turned at once on its
side. Then the shad began to go overboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first the throwing of the shad produced
no visible effect, and the attack on us continued
in unabated fury. Then the water began to foam
and twist where the shad were dropping, and on a
sudden we were left alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole pack forsook us to attack the shad.
How they fought and lashed and sprang and tore
in one mad turmoil of foam and fish!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Spread them a bit!&rsquo; B&mdash;&mdash; cried. &lsquo;Give
them all a chance, or they&rsquo;ll come back at us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She&rsquo;s afloat! she&rsquo;s afloat!&rsquo; he yelled the next
moment, in frantic delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chris threw out another dozen of fish. Then
he thrust his oar over the stern, and the big boat
moved slowly toward us. At intervals Chris
stopped and threw out more shad. As we eagerly
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
watched his approach the thought occurred to us
that when the boat should reach us it would be
with the whole pack surrounding it. The ravenous
creatures seemed almost ready to leap aboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We can use these oars and things as leaping-poles,&rsquo;
suggested B&mdash;&mdash;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll have to do,&rsquo; agreed the
rector. Then he cried to Chris, &lsquo;Bring her side
onto the shoal, so we can all jump aboard at the
same time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the boat drew nearer, Chris paused again,
and threw a score of shad far astern. Away
darted the dogfish; and the boat rounded up
close before us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The agility with which we sprang aboard was
remarkable, and Chris almost hugged us in his joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not another shad&rsquo;ll they git out er me!&rsquo; he
declared triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I should rather think not,&rdquo; remarked
the rector. &lsquo;But they might as well have some
more dogfish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With these words he put his foot upon the
gunwale, and his unwearying boat-hook went back
jubilantly into the battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rapidly loading and firing my shotgun, I
picked off as many of our enemies as I comfortably
could; and B&mdash;&mdash;, by lashing the boat&rsquo;s
hatchet on the end of the gaff, made a weapon
with which he played havoc among our foes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the fray lasted not much longer. Innumerable
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
as were yet the survivors, their hunger
was becoming appeased, and their ferocity diminished.
In a little while they sheered off to a safer
distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we had time to think of our own condition,
we found that our backs were painfully
scorched by the blazing June sun. As with pain
we struggled into our clothes, Chris trimmed our
course toward home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I reckon you know now &rsquo;bout all you&rsquo;ll
wanter know &rsquo;bout the ways o&rsquo; dogfish,&rsquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They are certainly very bloodthirsty,&rsquo; said
the rector; &lsquo;but at the same time they are interesting.
That they gave us a noble contest you
can&rsquo;t deny.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">When Queerman relapsed into silence, Ranolf
took up the parable without waiting to be called
upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queerman&rsquo;s story,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;reminds me of
an adventure of my own, which befell me in that
same tide-region which he has just been talking of.
You know, I spent much of my illustrious boyhood
about the Tantramar marshes, and overlooking
the yellow head-waters of the Bay of Fundy.
The name of my story is, &lsquo;The Bull and the
Leaping-Pole,&rsquo; and the scene of it is within a
mile of the spot whence Queerman and his crowd
set out for shad. It will serve to show what agility
I am capable of on a suitable occasion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<h3>THE BULL AND THE LEAPING-POLE.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Out on the Tantramar marshes the wind, as
usual, was racing with superfluous energy, bowing
all one way the purple timothy-tops, and rolling
up long green waves of grass that shimmered like
the sea under the steady afternoon sun. I revelled
in the fresh and breezy loneliness, which nevertheless
at times gave me a sort of thrill, as the
bobolinks, stopping their song for a moment, left
no sound in my ears save the confused &lsquo;swish&rsquo;
of the wind. Men talk at times of the loneliness
of the dark, but to my mind there is no more utter
solitude than may be found in a broad white glare
of sunshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here on the marsh, two miles from the skirt of
the uplands, perhaps half a mile from the nearest
incurve of the dike, on a twisted, sweet-smelling
bed of purple vetch, I lay pretending to read, and
deliciously dreaming. My bed of vetch sloped
gently toward the sun, being on the bank of a
little winding creek which idled through the long
grasses on its way to the Tantramar. Once a tidal
stream, the creek had been brought into subjection
by what the country people call a &lsquo;bito,&rsquo; built
across its mouth to shut out the tides; and now it
was little more than a rivulet at the bottom of the
deep gash which it had cut for itself through the
flats in its days of freedom. From my resting-place
I could see in the distance a marsh-hawk
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
noiselessly skimming the tops of the grass, peering
for field-mice; or a white gull wandering aimlessly
in from the sea. Beyond the dike rose the gaunt
skeletons of three or four empty net-reels; and a
little way off towards the uplands stood an old
barn used for storing hay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beside me among the vetch-blossoms, hummed
about by the great bumblebees and flickered over
by white and yellow butterflies, lay my faithful
leaping-pole,&mdash;a straight young spruce trimmed
and peeled, light and white and tough. Some
years before, fired by reading in <i>Hereward</i> of the
feats of &lsquo;Wulfric the Heron,&rsquo; I had bent myself
to learn to leap with the pole, and had become no
less skilful in the exercise than eagerly devoted
thereto. It gave me, indeed, a most fascinating
sense of freedom. Ditches, dikes, and fences were
of small concern to me, and I went craning it over
the country like a huge meadow-hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On this particular afternoon, which I am not
likely soon to forget, when the bobolinks had
hushed for so long that the whispering stillness
grew oppressive, I became ashamed of the weird
apprehension which kept stealing across me; and
springing to my feet with a shout, I seized my
leaping-pole, and went sailing over the creek hilariously.
It was a good leap, and I contemplated
the distance with satisfaction, marred only by the
fact that I had no spectators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shouted again, from full lungs; and
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
turning instinctively for applause toward the far-off
uplands, I became aware that I was not so much
alone as I had fancied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From behind the old barn, at the sound of
my voice, appeared a head and shoulders which
I recognized, and at the sight of which my satisfaction
vanished. They belonged to Atkinson&rsquo;s
bull, a notoriously dangerous brute, which only
the week before had gored a man fatally, and
which had thereupon been shut up and condemned
to the knife. As was evident, he had broken out
of his pen, and wandering hither to the marshes,
had been luxuriating in such plenty of clover as
well might have rendered him mild-mannered. I
thought of this for a moment; but the faint hope&mdash;it
was very faint&mdash;was at once and emphatically
dispelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slowly, and with an ugly bellow, he walked
his whole black-and-white length into view, took
a survey of the situation, and then, after a moment&rsquo;s
pawing, and some insulting challenges
which I did not feel in a position to accept, he
launched himself toward me with a sort of horrid
grunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the first chill I had quite recovered my
nerve, and realized at once that my chances lay
altogether in my pole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The creek was in many places too wide for me
to jump it in a clear leap from brink to brink of
the gully, but at other points it was well within
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
my powers. To the bull, however, I perceived
that it would be at all points a serious obstacle,
only to be passed by clambering first down and
then up the steep sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without waiting for close parley with my assailant,
I took a short run, and placed myself once
more amongst the vetch-blossoms whence I had
started. I had but time to cast my eye along, and
notice that about a stone&rsquo;s throw farther down,
toward the dike, the creek narrowed somewhat
so as to afford me an easier leap, when the hot
brute reached the edge opposite, and, unable to
check himself, plunged headlong into the gully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As he rolled and snorted in the water I could
scarcely help laughing; but my triumph was not
for long. The overthrow seemed to sting him into
tenfold fury. With a nimbleness that appalled me
he charged straight up the bank, and barely had
I taken to my heels ere he had reached the top
and was after me. So close was he that I failed
to make the point aimed at. I was forced to leap
desperately, and under such disadvantage that
only by a hair&rsquo;s-breadth did I gain the opposite
side. Somewhat shaken by the effort, I ran on
straightway to where I could command a less trying
jump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bull made no halt whatever, but plunged
right into the gully, rolled over, and all covered
with mud and streaming weeds was up the slope
again like a cat.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/img002.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="800" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;<span class="sc">I was forced to leap Desperately.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Page 48.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;But this performance delayed him, and gave
me a second or two, so that I was enabled to make
my leap with more deliberation and less effort.
As I did so, I noticed with gratitude that the
banks of the creek had here become much steeper.
The bull noticed it too, and paused, bellowing vindictively;
while as for me, I leaned on my trusty
pole to regain my breath. With more circumspection
this time the brute attempted the crossing,
but losing his foothold he came to the bottom,
as before, all in a heap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As he gathered himself up again for the ascent
I held my ground, resolved to move but a
yard or two aside when compelled, and not lightly
to quit a position so much to my advantage. But
here my foaming adversary found the slope too
steep for him, and after every charge he fell back
ignominiously into the water. It did not take him
long, however, to realize the situation, and dashing
up stream to his former crossing-place he
was at the top in a twinkling, and once more
bearing down upon me like a whirlwind of furies.
The respite had given me time to recover my
breath, and now with perfect coolness I transferred
myself once more to the other side. Upon
this my pursuer wheeled round, retraced his steps
without a pause, crossed over, and in a moment
I found my position again rendered untenable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, there was nothing else for it but
to make another jump; and in the result there
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
was no perceptible variation. The inexorable brute
left me no leisure to sit down and plan a diversion.
I was conscious of a burning anxiety to
get home, and I tried to calculate how much of
this sort of thing it would take to discourage
my tireless foe. Not arriving at any satisfactory
conclusion, I continued to make a shuttle-cock
of myself for some minutes longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately below me I saw that the sides of
the gully retained their steepness, but so widened
apart as to make the leap a doubtful one. At a
considerable distance beyond, however, they drew
together again, and at last I convinced myself that
a change of base would be justified. By such a
change, supposing it safely accomplished, it was
evident that I would gain much longer breathing-spells,
while my antagonist would be forced to
such detours as would surely soon dishearten him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the next chance, therefore, I broke at the
top of my speed for the new position. I had but
a scant moment to spare, for the bull was closing
upon me with his terrific gallop. I made my
jump, nevertheless, with deliberation. But, alas
for the &lsquo;best laid schemes o&rsquo; mice an&rsquo; men&rsquo;! I
had planted my pole in a spot of sticky clay, and
after a slow sprawl through the air I landed helplessly
on hands and knees about half-way up the
opposite bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing my mishap, the bull forgot his late-learned
caution, and, charging headlong, brought
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
up not a couple of yards below me. Without
waiting to pull my pole out of the mud I scrambled
desperately to the top. It was a sick moment
for me as the brute recovered his footing,
and made up the steep so impetuously that he
almost conquered it; but I threw myself flat on
my face and reached for the pole, knowing well
that without it the game was pretty well up for
me. As I succeeded in wrenching it from the
clay, my pursuer&rsquo;s rush brought him so close that
I could almost touch his snorting and miry nostrils.
But this was his best effort, and he could
come no nearer. Realizing this, he did just what
I expected him to do,&mdash;gave his tail an extra
twist of relentless malice, and swept off up the
bed of the creek to his former place of transit. I
now breathed more freely; and having prodded
the bottom till I found a firm foundation for my
pole, I began to feel secure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the bull had gained my side of the
creek, and had come so far as to insure his coming
all the way, I sprang across; and a moment
later saw him tearing up the soil on the very spot
my feet had just forsaken. This time he shirked
the plunge, and stood on the bank bellowing his
challenge. I patted my good spruce pole. Then
I threw some sods across at him, which resulted
in a fresh tempest, a new rush to the old crossing,
and another &lsquo;over&rsquo; for my leaping-pole and
me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile I had concocted a plan for check-mating
my antagonist. I saw that from this point
forward to the dike the gully became more and
more impassable, and I thought if I could lure the
bull into following me but for a little way down
the opposite bank, I could gain such a start upon
him that to reach the dike would be an easy
matter. With this design then, when the bull
again repeated his angry challenge, I shouted,
threw another sod, and started on a trot down the
creek. But the cunning brute was not to be deceived
in such fashion. He turned at once to
repeat his former tactics, and I was fain to retrace
my steps precipitately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brute now resolved, apparently, upon a
waiting game. After pawing his defiance afresh,
he proceeded to walk around and eat a little, ever
and anon raising his head to eye me with a sullen
and obstinate hatred. For my own part, now that
time had ceased to be an object, I sat down and
racked my brains over the problem. Would the
brute keep up this guard all through the night?
I felt as if there was a sleuth-hound on my trail.
That now silent presence across the creek began
to weigh upon me like a nightmare. At last, in
desperation, I resolved upon a straight-away race
for the dike. As I pondered on the chances, they
seemed to grow more and more favorable. I was
a good runner, and though handicapped with the
pole, would have a fair start on my enemy. Having
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
made up my mind to the venture I rose to my
feet, ready to seize the smallest advantage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I rose, the bull wheeled sharply, and sprang
to the edge of the bank with a muffled roar. But
seeing that I stood leaning idly on my pole and
made no motion to depart, he soon tossed away
in the sulks and resumed his grazing. In a few
moments a succulent streak of clover so engrossed
him that he turned his back fairly upon me&mdash;and
like a flash I was off, speeding noiselessly over the
grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not till several seconds had been gained did
I hear the angry bellow which told of the detection
of my stratagem. I did not stop to look
back, and I certainly made some very pretty running;
but the dike seemed still most dismally
remote when I heard that heavy gallop plunging
behind me. Nearer, nearer it drew, with terrible
swiftness; and nearer and nearer drew the dike.
I reached it where it was perhaps about seven feet
high. Slackening up to plant my pole squarely, I
sprang, and had barely time to steady myself on
the summit when the beast brought up with a roar
at my very feet. It was a narrow, a very narrow
escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a sigh of relief and gratitude I sat me
down to rest, and took some satisfaction in poking
the ribs of the baffled brute below. Then, lightly
balancing my pole in one hand, I turned my face
toward the &lsquo;bito,&rsquo; and made my way thoughtfully
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
homeward. It was altogether too literally a
&lsquo;hair&rsquo;s-breadth&rsquo; adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">When Ranolf concluded there was a general
stir. Pipes were refilled, and a &ldquo;snack&rdquo; (of biscuits,
cheese, and liquids to taste) was passed
around. Then Stranion said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn, O. M.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s bedtime,&rdquo; pleaded I; &ldquo;and besides,
as I have the writing to do, let others do the
speaking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My arguments were received with a stony stare,
so I made haste to begin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like Magnus,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;modesty forbids me
to be my own hero. I&rsquo;ll tell you a story which
I picked up last fall, when I was alleged to be
pigeon-shooting twenty miles above Fredericton.
We will call the yarn&mdash;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;SAVED BY THE CATTLE.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I was talking to an old farmer whom I had
chanced to come across, and who had passed me
a cheery good-day. After I had spoken of the
crops, and he had praised my new gun, I broached
a subject of much interest to myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you account for the fact, if it is a
fact,&rdquo; said I, slipping a cartridge into my right
barrel, &ldquo;that the caribou are getting yearly more
numerous in the interior of New Brunswick, while
other game seems to be disappearing. As for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
wild pigeons, you may say they are all gone.
Here I have been on the go since before sunrise,
and that bird is the only sign of a pigeon I have
so much as got a glimpse of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; replied my companion, as for the
pigeons, I can&rsquo;t say how it is. In old times I&rsquo;ve
seen them so plenty round here you could knock
them down with a stick; that is, if you were anyways
handy with a stick. But they do say that
caribou are increasing because the wolves have
disappeared. You see, the wolves used to be the
worst enemy of the caribou, because they could
run them down nice and handy in winter, when
the snow was deep and the crust so thin that the
caribou were bound to break through it at every
step. However, I don&rsquo;t believe there has been
a wolf seen in this part of the country for fifty
years, and it&rsquo;s only within the last ten years or
so that the caribou have got more plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had seated ourselves, the old farmer and
I, on a ragged snake-fence that bounded a buckwheat-field
overlooking the river. The field was
a new clearing, and the ripened buckwheat reared
its brown heads among a host of blackened and
distorted stumps. It was a crisp and delicious
autumn morning, and the solitary pigeon that had
rewarded my long tramp over the uplands was
one that I had surprised at its breakfast in the
buckwheat. Now, finding that my new acquaintance
was likely to prove interesting, I dropped my
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
gun gently into the fence corner, loosened my belt
a couple of holes, and asked the farmer if he had
himself ever seen any wolves in New Brunswick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not to say many,&rsquo; was the old man&rsquo;s reply;
&lsquo;but they say that troubles never come single,
and so, what wolves I <i>have</i> seen, I saw them all
in a heap, so to speak.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As he spoke, the old man fixed his eyes on a
hilltop across the river, with a far-off look that
seemed to promise a story. I settled into an attitude
of encouraging attention, and waited for him
to go on. His hand stole deep into the pocket of
his gray homespun trousers, and brought to view
a fig of &lsquo;black-jack,&rsquo; from which he gnawed a
thoughtful bite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instinctively he passed the tobacco to me; and
on my declining it, which I did with grave politeness,
he began the following story:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was a little shaver about thirteen
years old, I was living on a farm across the river,
some ten miles up. It was a new farm, which
father was cutting out of the woods; but it had
a good big bit of &lsquo;interval,&rsquo; so we were able to
keep a lot of stock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One afternoon late in the fall, father sent me
down to the interval, which was a good two miles
from the house, to bring the cattle home. They
were pasturing on the aftermath; but the weather
was getting bad, and the grass was about done,
and father thought the &lsquo;critters,&rsquo; as we called
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
them, would be much better in the barn. My
little ten-year-old brother went with me, to help
me drive them. That was the time I found out
there were wolves in New Brunswick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The feed being scarce, the cattle were scattered
badly; and it was supper-time before we got
them together, at the lower end of the interval,
maybe three miles and a half from home. We
didn&rsquo;t mind the lateness of the hour, however,
though we were getting pretty hungry, for we
knew the moon would be up right after sundown.
The cattle after a bit appeared to catch on to the
fact that they were going home to snug quarters
and good feed, and then they drove easy and hung
together. When we had gone about half-way up
the interval, keeping along by the river, the moon
got up and looked at us over the hills, very sharp
and thin. &lsquo;Ugh!&rsquo; says Teddy to me in half a
whisper, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t she make the shadows black?&rsquo;
He hadn&rsquo;t got the words more than out of his
mouth when we heard a long, queer, howling
sound from away over the other side of the interval;
and the little fellow grabbed me by the
arm, with his eyes fairly popping out of his head.
I can see his startled face now; but he was a
plucky lad for his size as ever walked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sounds mighty like the wind,&rsquo; said I, though
I knew it wasn&rsquo;t the wind, for there wasn&rsquo;t a
breath about to stir a feather.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;The sound came from a wooded valley winding
down between the hills. It <i>was</i> something
like the wind, high and thin, but by and by getting
loud and fierce and awful, as if a lot more
voices were joining in; and I just tell you my
heart stopped beating for a minute. The cattle
heard it, you&rsquo;d better believe, and bunched together,
kind of shivering. Then two or three
young heifers started to bolt; but the old ones
knew better, and hooked them back into the
crowd. Then it flashed over me all at once. You
see, I was quite a reader, having plenty of time
in the long winters. Says I to Teddy, with a kind
of sob in my throat, &lsquo;I guess it must be wolves.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I
guess so,&rsquo; says Teddy, getting brave after
his first start. And then, not a quarter of a mile
away, we saw a little pack of gray brutes dart
out of the woods into the moonlight. I grabbed
Teddy by the hand, and edged in among the cattle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s get up a tree!&rsquo; said Teddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course we will,&rsquo; said I, with a new hope
rising in my heart. We looked about for a suitable
tree in which we might take refuge, but our
hopes sank when we saw there was not a decent-sized
tree in reach. Father had cleared off everything
along the river-bank except some Indian
willow scrub not six feet high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the cattle, now, had scattered for home, I
guess it would have been all up with Teddy and
me, and father and mother would have been mighty
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
lonesome on the farm. But what do you suppose
the &lsquo;critters&rsquo; did? When they saw those gray
things just lengthening themselves out across the
meadow, the old cows and the steers made a regular
circle, putting the calves&mdash;with me and
Teddy&mdash;in the centre. They backed in onto us
pretty tight, and stood with their heads out and
horns down, for all the world like a company of
militia forming square to receive a charge of cavalry.
And right good bayonets they made, those
long, fine horns of our cattle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To keep from being trodden on, Teddy and I
got onto the backs of a couple of yearlings, who
didn&rsquo;t like it any too well, but were packed in
so tight they couldn&rsquo;t help themselves. As the
wolves came streaking along through the moonlight,
they set up again that awful, shrill, wind-like,
swelling howl, and I thought of all the
stories I had read of the wolves of Russia and
Norway, and such countries; and the thought
didn&rsquo;t comfort me much. I didn&rsquo;t know what I
learned afterward, that the common wolf of North
America is much better fed than his cousin in the
Old World, and consequently far less bloodthirsty.
I seemed to see fire flashing from the eyes of the
pack that were rushing upon us; and I thought
their white fangs, glistening in the moonlight,
were dripping with the blood of human victims.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I expect father&rsquo;ll hear that noise,&rsquo; whispered
Ted, &lsquo;and he and Bill&rsquo; (that was the hired man)
&lsquo;will come with their guns and save us.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I scornfully; &lsquo;I suppose you&rsquo;d like
them to come along now, and get eaten up by the
wolves!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was mighty sorry afterward for speaking
that way, for it near broke Teddy&rsquo;s heart. However,
sobbing a bit, the little fellow urged in self-defence,
&lsquo;Why, there&rsquo;s only five wolves anyway,
and father and Bill could easily kill them!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was true. There were just five of the
brutes, though my excited eyes had been seeing
about fifty&mdash;just such a pack as I had been used
to reading about. However, these five seemed
mighty hungry, and now they were right onto us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they weren&rsquo;t used to cattle like ours.
Father&rsquo;s old black-and-white bull was running
the affair that night, and he stood facing the attack.
The wolves never halted; but with their
red tongues hanging out, and their narrow jaws
snapping like fox-traps, they gave a queer, nasty
gasp that it makes my blood run cold to think of,
and sprang right onto the circle of horns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We heard the old bull mumble something
away down in his throat, and he sort of heaved
up his hind-quarters and pitched forward, without
leaving the ranks. The next thing we saw, one
of his long horns was through the belly of the
leader wolf, and the animal was tossed up into the
air, yelping like a kicked dog. He came down
with a thud, and lay snapping at the grass and
kicking; while the other four, who had been repulsed
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
more or less roughly, drew back and eyed
their fallen comrade with an air of disapproval. I
expected to see them jump upon him and eat
him at once, but they didn&rsquo;t; and I began to distrust
the stories I had read about wolves. It appeared,
however, that it was not from any sense
of decency that they held back, but only that they
wanted beef rather than wolf meat, as we found a
little later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently one of the four slouched forward, and
sniffed at his dying comrade. The brute was still
lively, however, and snapped his teeth viciously at
the other&rsquo;s legs, who thereupon slouched back to
the pack. After a moment of hesitation, the four
stole silently, in single file, round and round the
circle, turning their heads so as to glare at us all
the time, and looking for a weak spot to attack.
They must have gone round us half a dozen times,
and then they sat down on their tails, and stuck
their noses into the air, and howled and howled
for maybe five minutes steady. Teddy and I,
who were now feeling sure our &lsquo;critters&rsquo; could
lick any number of wolves, came to the conclusion
the brutes thought they had too big a job on
their hands and were signalling for more forces.
&lsquo;Let &rsquo;em come,&rsquo; exclaimed Teddy. But we were
getting altogether too confident, as we soon found
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After howling for a while, the wolves stopped
and listened. Then they howled again, and again
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
they stopped and listened; but still no answer
came. At this they got up and once more began
prowling round the circle, and everywhere they
went you could see the long horns of the cattle
pointing in their direction. I can tell you cattle
know a thing or two more than they get credit for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when the wolves came round to their
comrade&rsquo;s body, they saw it was no longer kicking,
and one of them took a bite out of it as if by
way of an experiment. He didn&rsquo;t seem to care
for wolf, and turned away discontentedly. The
idea struck Teddy as so funny that he laughed
aloud. The laugh sounded out of place, and fairly
frightened me. The cattle stirred uneasily; and
as for Teddy, he wished he had held his tongue,
for the wolf turned and fixed his eye upon him,
and drew nearer and nearer, till I thought he was
going to spring over the cattle&rsquo;s heads and seize us.
But in a minute I heard the old bull mumbling
again in his throat; and the wolf sprang back
just in time to keep from being gored. How I
felt like hugging that bull!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cheered Teddy up, and told him not to
laugh or make a noise again. As the little fellow
lifted his eyes he looked over my shoulder, and,
instantly forgetting what I had been saying,
shouted, &lsquo;Here come father and Bill!&rsquo; I looked
in the same direction and saw them, sure enough,
riding furiously towards us. But the wolves
didn&rsquo;t notice them, and resumed their prowling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;On the other side of the circle from our champion,
the black-and-white bull, there stood a nervous
young cow; and just at this time the wolf
who had got his eye on Teddy seemed to detect
this weak spot in the defence. Suddenly he
dashed like lightning on the timid cow, who
shrank aside wildly, and opened a passage by
which the wolf darted into the very centre of
the circle. The brute made straight for Teddy,
whom I snatched from his perch and dragged over
against the flank of the old bull. Instantly the
herd was in confusion. The young cow had
bounded into the open and was rushing wildly up
the interval, and three of the wolves were at her
flanks in a moment. The wolf who had marked
Teddy for his prey leaped lightly over a calf or
two, and was almost upon us, when a red &lsquo;moolley&rsquo;
cow, the mother of one of these calves, butted him
so fiercely as to throw him several feet to one side.
Before he could reach us a second time the old
bull had spotted him. Wheeling in his tracks, as
nimble as a squirrel, he knocked me and Teddy
over like a couple of ninepins, and was onto the
wolf in a flash. How he did mumble and grumble
way down in his stomach; but he fixed the wolf.
He pinned the brute down and smashed him with
his forehead, and then amused himself tossing the
body in the air; and just at this moment father
and Bill rode up and snatched us two youngsters
onto their saddles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you hurt?&rsquo; questioned father breathlessly.
But he saw in a moment we were not, for
we were flushed with pride at the triumph of our
old bull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And be they any more wolves, so&rsquo;s I kin git
a shot at &rsquo;em?&rsquo; queried Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Old Spot has fixed two of &rsquo;em,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And there&rsquo;s the other two eating poor Whitey
over there,&rsquo; exclaimed Teddy, pointing at a snarling
knot of creatures two or three hundred yards
across the interval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure enough, they had dragged down poor
Whitey and were making a fine meal off her carcass.
But Bill rode over and spoiled their fun.
He shot two of them, while the other left like a
gray streak. And that&rsquo;s the last <i>I&rsquo;ve</i> seen of
wolves in this part of the country!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That was a close shave,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;and the
cattle showed great grit. I&rsquo;ve heard of them
adopting tactics like that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the old farmer, getting down from
the fence rail and picking up his tin can. &lsquo;I
must be moving. Good-day to you.&rsquo; Before he
had taken half a dozen steps he turned round and
remarked, &lsquo;I suppose, now, if those had been Norway
wolves or Roossian wolves, the &ldquo;critters&rdquo;
would have had no show?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very little, I imagine,&rsquo; was my answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether it was that my story had gone far
toward putting every one to sleep, I know not.
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
The fact remains, to be interpreted as one will,
that no longer was there any objection raised when
I proposed that we should turn in. That night, I
think, no one of us lay awake over long. Before
I dropped asleep I heard two owls hooting hollowly
to each other through the wet woods. The
sound changed gradually to a clamor of wolves
over their slain victim, and then to the drums
and trumpets of an army on the march; and
then I awoke to find it broad daylight, and Stranion
beating a tin pan just over my head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">AT CAMP DE SQUATOOK.</span></h2>
<p>The next morning we got off at a good hour.
For the last half mile of its course we found
Beardsley Brook so overgrown with alders that we
had to chop and haul our way through it with
infinite labor. Here we wasted some time fishing
for Sam&rsquo;s pipe, which had fallen overboard among
the alders. The pipe was black, with crooked
stem, plethoric in build, and so heavy that we all
thought it would sink where it fell. As soon as
the catastrophe occurred we halted till the water,
here about two feet deep, had become clear.
Then, peering down among the alder-stems, Ranolf
spied the pipe on the sandy bottom, looking
blurred and distorted through the writhing current.
Long we grappled for it, poking at it with
pole and paddle. We would cautiously raise it a
little way towards the surface; but even as we
began to triumph it would wriggle off again as
if actually alive, and settle languidly back upon
the sand. We all knew, without Ranolf&rsquo;s elaborate
explanations, that its lifelike movement was
due to its being so little heavier than the water
it displaced, or to the uneven refraction of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
light through the moving fluid, or to some other
equally satisfactory and scientific cause. Finally
Sam, getting impatient, plunged in arm and shoulder,
and grasped the pipe victoriously. He came
up empty-handed; and we beheld a huge tadpole,
now thoroughly aroused, flaunting off down stream
in high dudgeon. Ranolf remarked that the laws
of refraction were to him obscure; and we continued
our journey. The real pipe we overtook
farther down stream, floating along jauntily as a
cork.</p>
<p>Once out upon the Squatook River our course
was rapid, for the current was swift and the
channel clear. There were some wild rapids, but
we ran them victoriously. By noon we were on
the bosom of Big Squatook Lake. By six o&rsquo;clock
we had traversed this beautiful and solitary water,
and were pitching our tent near the outlet, on
a soft brown carpet of pine-needles. Here was
a circular opening amid the huge trunks. Between
the lake and our encampment hung a
screen of alder and wild-cherry, whence a white
beach of pebbles slanted broadly to the waves.
While Stranion and Queerman made preparations
for supper, the rest of us whipped the ripples of
the outlet for trout. The shores of the lake at
this spot draw together in two grand curves, and
at the apex flows out the Squatook River, about
waist-deep and a stone&rsquo;s throw broad. It murmurs
pleasantly on for the first few rods, and then
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
begins to dart and chafe, and lift an angry voice.
Hither the Indians come to spear whitefish in
their season. To assist their spearing they had
the outlet fenced part way across with a double
row of stakes. All but the smallest fish were
thus compelled to descend through a narrow passage,
wherein they were at the mercy of the spearman.
This fence we now found very convenient.
Letting the canoe drift against it, we perched on
top of the stakes, a couple of feet above water,
and cast our flies unimpeded in every direction.
The trout were abundant, and took the flies
freely. For an hour we had most exciting sport.
It was in itself, for all true fishermen, worth the
whole journey. The Squatook trout are of a good
average size, and very game. Of the twenty odd
fish we killed that evening, there were two that
passed the one and one-half pound scratch upon
our scales, and several that cleared the pound.</p>
<p>Deciding to spend some days in this fair spot,
we named it Camp de Squatook. Lopping the
lower branches of the trees, we made ourselves
pegs on which to hang our tins and other utensils;
while a dry cedar log, split skilfully by
Stranion, furnished us with slabs for a table.
Our commissariat was well supplied with campers&rsquo;
necessities and luxuries, but it was upon trout
above all that we feasted. Sometimes we boiled
them; sometimes we broiled them; more often we
fried them in the fragrant, yellow corn-meal. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
delicate richness of the hot, pink, luscious flakes
is only to be realized by those who feast on the
spoils of their own rods, with the relish of free
air and vigor and out-door appetites.</p>
<p>Campers prate much of early hours, and of
seeking their blankets with sunset; but we held
to no such doctrine. Night in these wilds is rich
with a mysterious beauty, an immensity of solitude
such as day cannot dream of. Supper over,
we stretched ourselves out between tent-door and
camp-fire, pillowing our heads on the folded bedding.
Across the yellow, fire-lit circle, through
the trunks and hanging branches, we watched
the still, gleaming level of the lake, whence at
intervals would ring out startlingly clear the goblin
laughter of the loon.</p>
<p>We were not so tired as on the previous evening,
and it took us longer to settle down into
the mood for story-telling. At last Stranion was
called upon. He was ready, and speech flowed
from him at once, as if his mouth had been just
uncorked.</p>
<h3>A NIGHT ENCOUNTER.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you a tale,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;of this very spot,
on this very Big Squatook; and, of course, with
me and the panther both in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once upon a time&mdash;that is to say in the
summer of 1886&mdash;I fished over these waters with
Tom Allison. You remember he was visiting
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
Fredericton nearly all that year. We camped
right here two days, and then went on to the
Little Lake, or Second Squatook, just below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moonlight night, when the windless little
lake before our camp was like a shield of silver,
and the woody mountains enclosing us seemed to
hold their breath for delight, I was seized with
an overwhelming impulse to launch the canoe and
pole myself up here to Big Squatook. The distance
between the two lakes is about a mile and
a half, with rapid water almost all the way; and
Allison, who had been amusing himself laboriously
all day, was too much in love with his pipe
and blankets by the camp-fire to think of accompanying
me. All my persuasions were wasted
upon him, so I went alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I had an excuse. I wanted to set
night-lines for the gray trout, or <i>togue</i>, which
haunt the waters of Big Squatook. A favorite
feeding-ground of theirs is just where the water
begins to shoal toward the outlet yonder. Strange
as it may seem, the togue are never taken in
Second Lake, or in any other of the Squatook
chain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a weird journey up-stream, I can tell
you. The narrow river, full of rapids, but so free
from rocks in this part of its course that its voice
seldom rises above a loud, purring whisper, was
overhung by many ancient trees. Through the
spaces between their tops fell the moonlight in
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
sharp white patches. As the long slow thrusts
of my pole forced the canoe stealthily upward
against the current, the creeping panorama of the
banks seemed full of elvish and noiseless life.
White trunks slipped into shadow, and black
stumps caught gleams of sudden radiance, till
the strangeness of it all began to impress me
more than its beauty, and I felt a curious and
growing sense of danger. I even cast a longing
thought backward toward the camp-fire&rsquo;s cheer
and my lazier comrade; and when at length, slipping
out upon the open bosom of the lake, I put
aside my pole and grasped my paddle, I drew a
breath of distinct relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It took but a few minutes to place my three
night-lines. This done, I paddled with slow
strokes toward that big rock far out yonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The broad surface was as unrippled as a mirror,
like it is now, save where my paddle and the
gliding prow disturbed it. When I floated motionless,
and the canoe drifted softly beyond the
petty turmoil of my paddle, it seemed as if I were
hanging suspended in the centre of a blue and
starry sphere. The magic of the water so persuaded
me, that presently I hauled up my canoe
on the rock, took off my clothes, and swam far
out into the liquid stillness. The water was cold,
but of a life-giving freshness; and when I had
dressed and resumed my paddle I felt full of
spirit for the wild dash home to camp, through
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
the purring rapids and the spectral woods. Little
did I dream just how wild that dash was to be!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the whitefish barrier where you
fellows were fishing this evening. Well, at the
time of my visit the barrier extended only to mid-channel,
one-half having been carried away, probably
by logs, in the spring freshets. For this
accident, doubtless very annoying to the Indians,
I soon had every reason to be grateful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I paddled noiselessly into the funnel, and
began to feel the current gathering speed beneath
me, and noted again the confused, mysterious
glimmer and gloom of the forest into which I
was drifting, I once more felt that unwonted sense
of danger stealing over me. With a word of vexation
I shook it off, and began to paddle fiercely.
At the same instant my eyes, grown keen and
alert, detected something strange about the bit of
Indian fence which I was presently to pass. It
was surely very high and massive in its outer
section! I stayed my paddle, yet kept slipping
quickly nearer. Then suddenly I arrested my
progress with a few mighty backward strokes.
Lying crouched flat along the tops of the stakes,
its head low down, its eyes fixed upon me, was
a huge panther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was completely at a loss, and for a minute
or two remained just where I was, backing water
to resist the current, and trying to decide what
was best to be done. As long as I kept to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
open water, of course I was quite safe; but I
didn&rsquo;t relish the idea of spending the night on
the lake. I knew enough of the habits and characteristics
of the panther to be aware the brute
would keep his eye on me as long as I remained
alone. But what I <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> know was how far a
panther could jump! Could I safely paddle past
that fence by hugging the farther shore? I felt
little inclined to test the question practically; so
I turned about and paddled out upon the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I drifted and shouted songs and stirred
up the echoes for a good round hour. I hoped,
rather faintly, that the panther would follow me
up the shore. This, in truth, he may have done;
but when I paddled back to the outlet, there he
was awaiting me in exactly the same position as
when I first discovered him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time I had persuaded myself that
there was ample room for me to pass the barrier
without coming in range of the animal&rsquo;s spring.
I knew that close to the farther shore the water
was deep. When I was about thirty yards from
the stakes, I put on speed, heading for just about
the middle of the opening. My purpose was to
let the panther fancy that I was coming within
his range, and then to change my course at the
last moment so suddenly that he would not have
time to alter his plan of attack. It is quite possible
that this carefully planned scheme was unnecessary,
and that I rated the brute&rsquo;s intelligence
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
and forethought quite too high. But however
that may be, I thought it safer not to take any
risks with so cunning an adversary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The panther lay in the sharp black shadow,
so that it was impossible for me to note his movements
accurately; but just as an instinct warned
me that he was about to spring, I swerved smartly
toward him, and hurled the light canoe forward
with the mightiest stroke I was capable of. The
man&oelig;uvre was well executed, for just before I
came fairly opposite the grim figure on the stake-tops,
the panther sprang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instinctively I threw myself forward, level
with the cross-bars; and in the same breath there
came a snarl and a splash close beside me. The
brute had miscalculated my speed, and got himself
a ducking. I chuckled a little as I straightened
up; but the sigh of relief which I drew at the
same time was profound in its sincerity. I had
lamentably underestimated the reach of the panther&rsquo;s
spring. He had alighted close to the
water&rsquo;s edge, just where I imagined the canoe
would be out of reach. I looked around again.
He was climbing alertly out of the hated bath.
Giving himself one mighty shake, he started after
me down along the bank, uttering a series of harsh
and piercing screams. With a sweep of the paddle
I darted across current, and placed almost the
full breadth of the river between my enemy and
myself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have paddled many a canoe-race, but never
one that my heart was so set upon winning as
this strange one in which I now found myself
straining every nerve. The current of the Squatook
varies greatly in speed, though nowhere is it
otherwise than brisk. At first I gained rapidly
on my pursuer; but presently we reached a spot
where the banks were comparatively level and
open; and here the panther caught up and kept
abreast of me with ease. With a sudden sinking
at the heart I called to mind a narrow gorge a
quarter of a mile ahead, from the sides of which
several drooping trunks hung over the water.
From one of these, I thought the panther might
easily reach me, running out and dropping into
the canoe as I darted beneath. The idea was a
blood-curdling one, and spurred me to more desperate
effort; but before we neared the perilous
pass the banks grew so uneven and the underbrush
so dense that my pursuer was much delayed,
and consequently fell behind. The current
quickening its speed at the same time, I was a
good ten yards in the lead, as my canoe slid
through the gorge and out into the white moonlight
of one of the wider reaches of the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I slackened my pace in order to recover
my wind; and the panther made up his lost
ground. For the time, I was out of his reach,
and all he could do was to scream savagely.
This, I supposed, was to summon his mate to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
noble hunting he had provided for her; but to
my inexpressible satisfaction no mate came. The
beauty and the weirdness of the moonlit woods
were now quite lost upon me. I saw only that
long, fierce, light-bounding figure which so inexorably
kept pace with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To save my powers for some possible emergency,
I resolved to content myself, for the time,
with a very moderate degree of haste. The panther
was in no way pressed to keep up with me.
Suddenly he darted forward at his utmost speed.
For a moment this did not trouble me; but then
I awoke to its possible meaning. He was planning,
evidently, an ambuscade, and I must keep
an eye upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The order of the chase was promptly reversed,
and I set out at once in a desperate pursuit. The
obstructed shores and the increasing current favored
me, so that he found it hard to shake me
off. For the next half mile I just managed to
keep up with him. Then came another of those
quieter reaches, and my pursued pursuer at last
got out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again I paused, not only to take breath, but
to try and discover the brute&rsquo;s purpose in leaving
me. All at once it flashed into my mind. Just
before the river widens into Second Lake, there
occurs a lively and somewhat broken rapid. As
there was moonlight, and I knew the channels
well, I had no dread of this rapid till suddenly
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
I remembered three large bowlders crossing the
stream like stepping-stones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was plain to me that this was the point
my adversary was anxious to reach ahead of me.
These bowlders were so placed that he could
easily spring from one to the other dry-shod, and
his chance of intercepting me would be excellent.
I almost lost courage. The best thing I could do
under the circumstances was to save my strength
to the utmost; so for a time I did little more than
steer the canoe. When at last I rounded a turn,
and saw just ahead of me the white, thin-crested,
singing ripples of the rapid, I was not at all surprised
to see also the panther, crouched on one of
the rocks in mid-stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this point the river was somewhat spread
out, and the banks were low, so the moonlight
showed me the channel quite clearly. You&rsquo;ll understand
better when we run through in a day or
two. I laid aside my paddle and took up the more
trusty white spruce pole. With it I &ldquo;snubbed&rdquo;
the canoe firmly, letting her drop down the slope
inch by inch, while I took a cool and thorough
survey of the ripples and cross-currents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the sloping shoulder of the rock lying
nearest to the left-hand bank a strong cross-current
took a slant sharply over toward the middle
channel. I decided to stake my fate on the assistance
of this cross-current. Gradually I snubbed
the canoe over to the left bank, and then gave her
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
her head. The shores slipped past. The rocks,
with that crouching sentinel on the central one,
seemed to glide up-stream to meet me. I was
almost in the passage when, with a superb bound,
the panther shot through the moonlight and lit
upon the rock I was approaching! As he poised
himself, gaining his balance with some difficulty
on the narrow foothold, a strong lunge with my
pole twisted the canoe into the swirl of that
cross-current; and with the next thrust I slid
like lightning down the middle channel before
my adversary had more than got himself fairly
turned around! With a shout of exultation I
raced down the rest of the incline and into widening
reaches, safe from pursuit. The panther,
screaming angrily, followed me for a time; but
soon the receding shores placed such a distance
between us that I ceased to regard him. Presently
I bade him a final farewell, and headed
across the lake for the spot where the camp-fire
was waving me a ruddy welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s getting pretty near home,&rdquo; remarked
Ranolf, glancing apprehensively into the gloom
behind the camp. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose that chap
would be waiting around here for you, Stranion?
If so, I hope he won&rsquo;t mistake me for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Sam give us something cheerful now!&rdquo;
demanded Magnus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a story of the
lumber-camps. I&rsquo;ll call it&mdash;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/img003.jpg" alt="" width="563" height="801" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;<span class="sc">With the next Thrust I slid like Lightning down the Middle Channel.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Page 78.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<h3>&lsquo;BRUIN AND THE COOK.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;As the O. M. is going to dress up our yarns
for the cold light of print, I must be allowed to
preface the story with a few introductory remarks
on the life of the lumbermen in winter. Stranion
and the O. M. know all about that; but the rest
of you fellows never go to the lumber-camps,
you know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To one who visits the winter camps here in
our backwoods, the life led by the loggers is likely
to seem monotonous after the strangeness of it has
worn off. The sounds of the chopping, the shouting,
the clanking of the teams, afford ample warning
to all the wild creatures of the woods, who
thereupon generally agree in giving a wide berth
to a neighborhood which has suddenly grown so
populous and noisy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In chopping and hauling logs the lumbermen
are at work unremittingly from dawn until
sun-down, and at night they have little energy
to expend on the hunting of bears or panthers.
The bunks and the blankets exert an overwhelming
attraction; and by the time the men have concluded
their after-supper smoke, and the sound of
a few rough songs has died away, the wild beasts
may creep near enough to smell the pork and
beans, and may prowl about the camp until dawn,
with small fear of molestation from the sleepers
within.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;At intervals, however, the monotony of camp-life
is broken. Something occurs to remind the
careless woodsmen that, though in the wilderness,
indeed, they are yet not truly of it. They are
made suddenly aware of those shy but savage
forces which, regarding them ever as trespassers,
have been keeping them under an angry and eager
surveillance. The spirit of the violated forest
makes a swift and sometimes effectual, but always
unexpected, stroke for vengeance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A yoke of oxen are straining at their load:
a great branch reaching down catches the nearest
ox by the horn, and the poor brute falls in its
track with its neck broken. A stout sapling is
bent to the ground by a weight of ice and snow:
some thaw or the shock of a passing team releases
it, and by the fierce recoil a horse&rsquo;s leg is
shattered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lumberman has strayed off into the woods
by himself, perchance to gather spruce-gum for
his friends in the settlements, and he is found,
days afterwards, half-eaten by bears and foxes. A
solitary chopper throws down his axe and leans
against a tree to rest and dream, and a panther
drops from the branches above and tears him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet such vengeance is accomplished but seldom,
and makes no permanent impression on the
heedless woodsman. His onward march is inexorable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cook, it must be borne in mind, is a most
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
important personage in the lumber-camp. This I
say of camp-cooks in general, and I assert it in
particular of the cook who figures as one of the
heroes in my story. The other hero is the bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a bright March morning at Nicholson&rsquo;s
camp over on Salmon River. There had been
a heavy thaw for some days, and the snowbanks
under the eaves of the camp were shrinking rapidly.
The bright chips about the door, the trampled
straw and fodder around the stable, were
steaming and soaking under the steady sun. Such
winds as were stirring abroad that day were quite
shut off from the camp by the dark surrounding
woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the protruding stovepipe, which did duty
as a chimney, a faint blue wreath of smoke curled
lazily. The cook had the camp all to himself for
a while; for the teams and choppers were at work
a mile away, and the &lsquo;cookee,&rsquo; as the cook&rsquo;s assistant
is called, had betaken himself to a neighboring
pond to fish for trout through the ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dishes were washed, the camp was in
order, and in a little while it would be time to
get the dinner ready. The inevitable pork and
beans were slowly boiling, and an appetizing fragrance
was abroad on the quiet air. The cook
decided to snatch a wink of sleep in his bunk beneath
the eaves. He had a spare half-hour before
him, and under his present circumstances he knew
no better way of spending it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;The weather being mild, he left the camp-door
wide open, and, swinging up to his berth,
soon had himself luxuriously bedded in blankets,&mdash;his
own and as many other fellows&rsquo; blankets
as he liked. He began to doze and dream. He
dreamed of summer fields, and then of a lively
Sunday-school picnic, and at last of the music
of a band which he heard crashing in his ears.
Then the cymbals and the big drum grew unbearably
loud, and, waking with a start, he remembered
where he was, and thrust his head in astonishment
over the edge of the bunk. The sight that met
his eyes filled him with alarm and indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prolonged thaw had brought out the
bears from their snug winter quarters; and now,
in a very bad humor from having been waked
up too soon, they were prowling through the forest
in unusual numbers. Food was scarce; in
fact, times were very hard with them, and they
were not only bad-humored, but lean and hungry
withal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To one particularly hungry bear the smell of
our cook&rsquo;s simmering pork had come that morning
like the invitation to a feast. The supposed invitation
had been accepted with a rapturous alacrity.
Bruin had found the door open, the coast
clear, the quarters very inviting. With the utmost
good faith he had entered upon his fortune.
To find the source of that entrancing fragrance
had been to his trained nose a simple matter.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">

<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Bruin and the Cook.</span>&mdash;Page 83.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;While cook slept sweetly, Bruin had rooted
off the cover of the pot, and this was the beginning
of cook&rsquo;s dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the pot was hot, and the first mouthful
of the savory mess made him yell with rage and
pain. At this point the trumpets and clarions
grew shrill in cook&rsquo;s dreaming ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then an angry sweep of the great paw had
dashed pot and kettle off the stove in a thunder
of crashing iron and clattering tins. This was
the point at which cook&rsquo;s dream had attained
overwhelming reality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What met his round-eyed gaze, as he sat up in
his blankets, was an angry bear, dancing about in
a confusion of steam and smoke and beans and
kettles, making ineffectual snatches at a lump of
scalding pork upon the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a moment of suspense, cook rose softly
and crept to the other end of the bunks, where a
gun was kept. To his disgust the weapon was
unloaded. But the click of the lock had caught
the bear&rsquo;s attention. Glancing up at the bunk
above him, the brute&rsquo;s eye detected the shrinking
cook, and straightway he overflowed with wrath.
Here, evidently, was the author of his discomfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With smarting jaws and vengeful paws he made
a dash for the bunk. Its edge was nearly seven
feet from the floor, so Bruin had to do some clambering.
As his head appeared over the edge, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
his great paws took firm hold upon the clapboard
rim of the bunk, cook, now grown desperate, struck
at him wildly with the heavy butt of the gun.
But Bruin is always a skilful boxer. With an
upward stroke he warded off the blow, and sent
the weapon spinning across the camp. At the
same time, however, his weight proved too much
for the frail clapboard to which he was holding,
and back he fell on the floor with a shock like an
earthquake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This repulse&mdash;which, of course, he credited to
the cook&mdash;only filled him with tenfold greater
fury, and at once he sprang back to the assault;
but the delay, however brief, had given poor cook
time to grasp an idea, which he proceeded to
act upon with eagerness. He saw that the hole
in the roof through which the stovepipe protruded
was large enough to give his body passage.
Snatching at a light rafter above his head, he
swung himself out of the bunk, and kicked the
stovepipe from its place. The sections fell with
loud clatter upon the stove and the bear, for a
moment disconcerting Bruin&rsquo;s plans. From the
rafter it was an easy reach to the opening in the
roof, and as Bruin gained the empty bunk and
stretched his paw eagerly up toward his intended
victim on the rafter, the intended victim slipped
with the greatest promptitude through the hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this point the cook drew a long breath,
and persuaded his heart to go down out of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
throat, where it had been since he waked, and
resume its proper functions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His first thought was to drop from the roof
and run for help, but fortunately he changed his
mind. The bear was no fool. No sooner had the
cook got safely out upon the roof than Bruin
rushed forth from the camp-door, expecting to
catch him as he came down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had cook acted upon his first impulse, he
would have been overtaken before he had gone a
hundred yards, and would have perished hideously
in the snow. As it was, however,&mdash;evidently to
Bruin&rsquo;s deep chagrin,&mdash;he stuck close to the chimney-hole,
like a prairie-dog sitting by his burrow,
ready at a moment&rsquo;s notice to plunge within,
while the bear stalked deliberately twice around
the camp, eying him, and evidently laying plans,
as it were, for his capture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last the bear appeared to make up his
mind. At one corner of the shanty, piled up
nearly to the eaves, was a store of firewood which
&lsquo;cookee&rsquo; had gathered in. Upon this pile Bruin
mounted, and then made a dash up the creaking
roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cook prayed most fervently that it might give
way beneath the great weight of the bear, and to
see if it would do so he waited almost too long;
but it did not. As he scurried, belated, through
the hole, the bear&rsquo;s paw reached its edge, and the
huge claws tore nearly all the flesh from the back
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
of the poor fellow&rsquo;s hand. Bleeding and trembling
he crouched upon the friendly rafter, not
daring to swing down into the bunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The agility of that great animal was marvellous.
Scarcely had cook got under shelter when
Bruin rushed in again at the door, and was up
on the bunk again in a twinkling, and again cook
vanished by the chimney-place. A moment later
the bear was again on the roof, while cook once
more crouched back faintly on his rafter. This
performance was repeated several times, till for
cook it had quite ceased to be interesting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last the chase grew monotonous even to
the indefatigable Bruin, who then resolved upon a
change of tactics. After driving cook out through
the chimney, he decided to try the same mode of
exit for himself, or at least to thrust his head
through the opening, and see what it was like.
Embracing the woodwork with his powerful forepaws,
he swung himself up on the rafter, as he
had seen cook do so gracefully. The attempt was
quite successful; but the rafter was not prepared
for the strain, and Bruin and beam came thundering
to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As cook gazed down through the hole, and
marked what had happened, his heart sank utterly
within him. His one safe retreat was gone. But
Bruin did not perceive his advantage, or else
was in no hurry to follow it up. The shock
had greatly dampened his zeal. He sat on his
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
haunches by the stove, and gazed up sullenly at
cook, while cook gazed back despairingly at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the bear noticed that the precious pork
had got deliciously cool, and in the charms of that
rare morsel cook was soon quite forgotten. All
cook had to do was to lie on the roof, nursing his
lacerated hand, and watching Bruin as he made
away with the lumbermen&rsquo;s dinner,&mdash;a labor of
love in which he lost no time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this junction a noise was heard in the
woods, and hope came back to the cook&rsquo;s heart.
The men were returning for dinner. Bruin heard
it too, and made haste to gulp down the remnant of
the beans. Just as teams and choppers emerged
into the little cleared space in front of the camp,
Bruin, having swallowed his last mouthful, rushed
out of the camp-door, to the breathless and immeasurable
amazement of the lumbermen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finding himself to all appearances surrounded,
Bruin paused a moment irresolutely. Then charging
upon the nearest team, he dealt the teamster
a terrific cuff, bowling him over in the snow and
breaking his arm, while the maddened horses
plunged, reared, and fell over backward in a
tangle of sleds and traces and lashing heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This episode brought the woodsmen to their
senses. Axe in hand, they closed in upon the
bear, who rose on his hind-quarters to meet them.
The first few blows that were delivered at him,
with all the force of practised arms and vindictive
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
energy, he warded off as if they were so many
feathers; but he could not guard himself on all
sides at once. A well-directed blow from the rear
sank the axe-head deep between his fore-shoulders,
severing the spinal column, and Bruin collapsed,
a furry heap, upon the crimsoned snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In their indignation over the cook&rsquo;s torn hand,
their comrade&rsquo;s broken arm, and&mdash;perhaps most
aggravating of all&mdash;their thoroughly demolished
dinner, the lumbermen undertook to make a meal
of Bruin; but in this attempt Bruin found a
measure of revenge, for in death he proved to be
even tougher than he had been in life, and the
famous luxury of a fat bear-steak was nowhere to
be had from his carcass.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;And now, Magnus,&rdquo; continued Sam, cleaning
out his pipe, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have something remote and
tropical from you, with your kind permission.
What else has happened to that uncle of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of things,&rdquo; said the imperturbable Magnus.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you one of his Mexican stories,
which he calls&mdash;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;AN ENCOUNTER WITH PECCARIES.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>This is, as near as I can remember, the way he
told it to me. I speak in his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my somewhat varied wanderings over the
surface of this fair round world,&rdquo; said my uncle,
&ldquo;I have had adventures more or less exciting,
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
and generally disagreeable, with wolves, bears, and
tigers, with irate and undiscriminating bulls, and
with at least one of those painfully unpleasant
horses, who have acquired a special relish for
human flesh. Some childish memories, moreover,
disclose to me at times that on more than one
occasion I have come off without laurels from a
contest with an indignant he-goat, and that I have
even been in peril at the wings of an unusually
aggressive gander. But of all the unpleasant
acquaintances to make when one is feeling solitary
and unprotected, I think a herd of irritated
peccaries will carry off the palm. Let these sturdy
little animals once conceive that their rights have
been ever so little menaced, and they are tireless,
implacable, and blindly fearless in their demand
for vengeance. Just what they may interpret as
a menace to their rights I suppose no man can
say with any confidence; but my own observation
has led me to believe that they think themselves
entitled to possess the earth. The earth is much
to be congratulated upon the fact that various climatic
considerations have hitherto prevented them
from entering upon their inheritance. The peccary
is confined, I believe, and I state it here
on the authority of reputable naturalists, to certain
tropical and sub-tropical regions of the New
World. My own limited acquaintance with the
creature was gained in Mexico.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toward the end of the seventies I was engaged
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
upon a survey of government lands in one
of the interior provinces of Mexico. Our party
was enjoying life, and troubled by few cares.
There were no bandits in that region. The scanty
inhabitants were more than well-disposed; they
were ready to bow down before us in their deferential
good-will. The climate, though emphatically
warm, was healthful and stimulating. There
were hardly enough pumas in the neighborhood to
add to our content the zest of excitement. There
were peccaries, as we were told in admonition, but
we had seen no sign of them; and when we
learned that they were only a kind of small wild
pig we took little stock in the tales we heard of
their unrelenting ferocity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On one of our numerous holidays&mdash;we could
not work our peons on any saint&rsquo;s day be it remembered&mdash;a
rumor of a remarkable waterfall
adorning a tributary of the stream which meandered
past our camp had taken me a longish ride
into the foothills of the Sierra. My journey was
along a little-frequented trail leading into the
mountains, and the scenery was fascinating in its
loveliness. I found the waterfall easily enough,
for the trail led past its very brink, and I was
more than rewarded for the trifling fatigue of my
ride. A vigorous stream, rolling from a winding
ravine in such a manner that it seemed to burst
right out of the mountain-side, leaped sparkling
and clamoring into the air from a curtain of emerald
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
foliage, and fell a distance of nearly two
hundred feet into a very valley of paradise. In
this valley, down into the bosom of which I gazed
from my height, the stream lingered to form a
sapphire lakelet, around whose banks grew the
most luxuriant of tree-ferns and mahoganies and
mesquits garlanded with gorgeous-bloomed lianas.
I could hear the cries of parrots rising from the
splendid coverts, and I thought what a delicious
retreat the valley would be but for its assortment
of snakes, miasma, and a probable puma or two.
I enjoyed the scene from my post, but I did not
descend. Then I turned my face homeward, well
content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horse I rode requires more than a passing
mention, for he played the most prominent and
most heroic part in the adventure which befell
me on my way home. He was a superb beast, a
blood bay, whom I had bought in the city of
Mexico from an American engineer who was leaving
the country. The animal, who answered to
the name of Diaz, had seen plenty of service in
the interior of Mexico, and his trained instincts
had kept me out of many dangers. I loved Diaz
as a faithful friend and servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I descended from the foothills the trail
grew heavy and soft, making our progress slow.
The land was open,&mdash;a succession of rank meadows,
with clumps of trees dotted here and there,
and pools on either side of the trail. Suddenly,
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
some distance in my rear, there arose a shrill, menacing
chorus of grunts and squeals, at which I
would fain have paused to listen. But Diaz recognized
the sounds, and bounded forward instantly
with every sign of apprehension. Then I said to
myself, &lsquo;It must be those peccaries of which I&rsquo;ve
heard so much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a moment or two I realized that it certainly
was those peccaries. They swarmed out of the
rank herbage and dashed after us, gnashing their
jaws; and, though Diaz was doing his best, the
herd gained upon us rapidly. They galloped
lightly over the soft soil wherein Diaz sank far
above his fetlocks. It took me but a moment to
realize, when at last face to face with them, that
the peccaries were just as dangerous as they had
been represented. And another moment sufficed
to show me that escape by my present tactics was
impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was armed with a light breech-loading rifle,&mdash;a
Remington,&mdash;and a brace of Smith &amp; Wessons
were sticking in my belt. Wheeling in my
saddle I took a snap shot at the pursuing herd,
and one of the animals tumbled in his tracks.
His fellows took no notice of this whatever.
Then I marked that Diaz appreciated our plight,
for he was trembling under me. I looked about
me, almost despairing of escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little behind, nearly half-way between us
and the peccaries, I saw a wide-spreading tree
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
close to the trail. We had passed it at the first
of the alarm. Ahead, as far as I could see, there
was no such refuge. Plenty of trees there were
indeed, but all standing off amid the swamps. I
decided at once upon a somewhat desperate course.
I turned Diaz about, and charged down upon the
peccaries with a yell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This stratagem appeared exactly to my horse&rsquo;s
taste. In fact, his attitude made me rather uncomfortable.
He seemed suddenly distraught.
He gave several short whinnying cries of challenge
or defiance, and rushed on with his mouth
wide open and his hips rolled back in a fashion
that made him look fiendish. My design was to
swing myself from the saddle into the tree that
overhung the trail, and so give Diaz a chance to
run away, when free of my weight. But Diaz
seemed bent on carrying the war into the enemy&rsquo;s
country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took one more shot at the peccaries, who
seemed no whit dismayed by the onset of Diaz.
I dropped my rifle, and kicked my feet out of the
stirrups. By this time we were under the tree,
and the peccaries with wild squeals were leaping
upon us. I had just succeeded in grasping a
branch above my head, and was swinging myself
up, when I saw Diaz spring into the air, and come
down with his forefeet upon one of the grunting
herd. The brute&rsquo;s back was broken. Almost in
the same instant my brave steed&rsquo;s teeth had made
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
short work of another peccary; but his flanks
were streaming with blood, and the dauntless animals
were literally climbing upon him and ripping
his hide with their short, keen tusks. I emptied
my revolvers rapidly, and half a dozen animals
dropped; but this made no appreciable difference
in their numbers. Meanwhile Diaz had gathered
himself together, and then, lashing out desperately
before and behind, had shaken himself free.
He sprang clear of the pack, and galloped off up
the trail toward the mountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The peccaries pursued him but a few paces,
and then returned to besiege my tree of refuge,
giving me an excellent opportunity for revolver
practice. As I was refilling my emptied chambers,
I heard a snorting screech coming down the
trail; and there to my amazement was Diaz returning
to the charge. But could that terrible-looking
beast be my gentle Diaz? His eyes seemed like
blazing coals, and his great jaws were dripping
with blood. The peccaries darted joyously into
the fray, but Diaz went right through and over
them like a whirlwind, mangling I know not how
many in his course, and disappeared down the
trail on the homeward road. His charge had been
murderous, but there were still plenty of my adversaries
left to make my beleaguerment all too
effective. I gazed wistfully after my heroic horse,
and then, perched securely astride a branch, I continued
my revolver practice. The peccaries, never
heeding the diminution of their ranks, and disdaining
to notice their wounds, kept scrambling
on one another&rsquo;s shoulders, and thrusting their
malignant snouts high into the air in the hope of
coming at me and satiating their revenge.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;<span class="sc">I emptied My Revolvers rapidly, and half a dozen Animals dropped.</span>&rdquo; Page 94.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the course of half an hour my little stock
of cartridges, used deliberately and effectively,
was gone; but so, as I congratulated myself,
were most of the peccaries. There were still half
a dozen, however; and these, as far as my imprisonment
was concerned, were as bad as fourscore.
These were incorruptible jailers; and I feared lest
their ceaseless, angry cries might summon another
herd to their assistance. When a couple of hours
had passed I grew deeply disgusted, and began to
plan my camping arrangements for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the act of tying some branches together to
make myself a safe couch, I caught the welcome
sound of voices approaching. It was my party
out in search of me. The arrival of Diaz, torn,
bloody-mouthed, and in a wild excitement, had, of
course, given them a terrible alarm; and they had
set off without delay, hardly expecting to find me
alive. A few shots from their rifles broke up the
siege, and the meagre remnant of the peccaries
fled into the swamps. When I got back to camp
I found that none of the peons dared to do anything
for Diaz, or even to approach him, he was
so furious and so erratic. To me he was submissive,
though with an effort. I dressed his
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
wounds, and gave him a heavy dose of aloes, and
in a day or two he was himself again. But I believe
he was on the verge of going mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">When Magnus ceased I murmured, &ldquo;I only
hope your uncle&rsquo;s adventures will last right
through this trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll call on Queerman
for something of a tender and idyllic tone;
eh, Queerman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll show
you, Sam, that I, too, know something of the
lumber-camps. Listen to a gentle&mdash;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;IDYL OF LOST CAMP.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;In the lumber-camps they still talk about the
great midwinter thaw that wrought such havoc
ten years back. It came on without warning
about the last week in February. There had been
heavy snowfalls in the early part of the winter,
and all through that district the snows were deep
and soft. Before the thaw came to an end these
great snow masses were dwindled to almost nothing,
and the ice had gone out of the rivers in a
series of tremendous floods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the lumber thieves the thaw was a magnificent
opportunity, of which they made haste to
avail themselves. Having no stumpage dues to
pay, they could afford a little extra outlay for the
difficult hauling. They were comparatively secure
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
from interruption, and the opening of the streams
gave them an opportunity of quickly getting their
spoils out of the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the most important camps of the district
at that time was that of the Ryckert Company,
on the Little St. Francis. On a Saturday
morning, the fourth day of the thaw, word was
brought into camp that the thieves were having a
delightful time over on Lake Pecktaweekaagomic,
on the Company&rsquo;s timber limits. Steve Doyle, the
boss of the camp, immediately called for volunteers
to attempt the capture of the marauders.
Every man at once came forward, with the exception
of the cook; and the boss, in order to excite
no jealousies, made his selection by lot. In half
an hour the squad was ready to set out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Be you agoin&rsquo; along, sir?&rsquo; inquired one of
the hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, of course!&rsquo; exclaimed Doyle. &lsquo;McCann
will be in charge here while we&rsquo;re gone.
There&rsquo;s such a thing possible as a brush with them
fellows, though I don&rsquo;t anticipate no trouble with
&rsquo;em. I reckon they&rsquo;re relyin&rsquo; on the thaw to keep
&rsquo;em from bein&rsquo; interrupted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I thought,&rsquo; responded the man who had just
spoken, &lsquo;as how the &ldquo;little feller&rdquo; might come
out to camp to-day, along of Mart, an&rsquo; you
mightn&rsquo;t want to miss him. He ain&rsquo;t been here
fur more&rsquo;n a month, now, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;re all kind of
expectin&rsquo; him to-day. You kin depend on us to
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
make a good job of it, ef so be&rsquo;s you&rsquo;d like to stay
by the camp. The hands all knows you too well
to think you stay home on account of bein&rsquo; <i>skeered</i>,
anyways!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this there was a general laugh; for Doyle&rsquo;s
reckless courage was famous in all the camps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the boss, after a thoughtful pause;
&lsquo;it&rsquo;s my place to go, and not to stay. Anyways,
I&rsquo;m not lookin&rsquo; for Arty to-day. His grandmother
ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to let him come when the road&rsquo;s so
bad. No!&rsquo; he continued with renewed emphasis,
&lsquo;this ain&rsquo;t no time for Arty in the woods.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without more discussion the band picked up
their dunnage and their guns, and set out for the
lake of the unpronounceable name. It is needless
to say the name became much shortened in their
careless lingo. On state occasions they sometimes
took pains to pronounce it &lsquo;Peckagomic.&rsquo; For
every-day use they found &lsquo;Gomic&rsquo; quite sufficient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the time the expedition was setting out
from the Ryckert Camp, far away in Beardsley
Settlement a very small boy was being tucked
comfortably into the straw and bearskins of a
roomy pung. As his grandmother kissed the
round, expectant little face, she said to the driver,
a slim youth of perhaps eighteen,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you think, now, Mart, the goin&rsquo; won&rsquo;t be
too bad? Be you sure the pung ain&rsquo;t likely to
slump down and upset? And then there&rsquo;s the
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
ice! This warm spell must have made it pretty
rotten! Will it be safe crossin&rsquo; the streams?
Somehow or other, I do jist hate lettin&rsquo; Arty go
along this mornin&rsquo;!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you be worryin&rsquo; a mite, marm,&rsquo; responded
Mart Babcock, gathering up the reins.
&lsquo;Ther&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t no ice to cross, seein&rsquo;s ther&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t no
rivers in our rowt, exceptin&rsquo; the Siegus, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s
got a bridge to it. I&rsquo;ll look after Arty, trust me.
His pa&rsquo;d be powerful disapp&rsquo;inted if I didn&rsquo;t
bring him along this time, to say nawthin&rsquo; of all
the hands!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said the old lady in a voice of
reluctant resignation; &lsquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s all right;
but take keer of him, Mart, as if he was the apple
of your eye!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a soft, hazy, melting day when Mart and
Arty set out on their long drive. The travelling
was heavy, but the air was delicious, and our
travellers were in the highest spirits. This visit
to the camp was Arty&rsquo;s dearest treat, and was allowed
him three or four times during the winter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toward noon the hazy blue of the morning sky
changed to a thick gray, while the air grew almost
oppressively warm, and the woods were filled on
all sides with the strange, innumerable noises of
the great thaw. The dull crunchings of the settling
masses of snow at first thrilled the child with
a vague alarm. Then, reassured by his companion,
he grew interested in trying to distinguish
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
the varied sounds. The unbending of softened
twigs and saplings, the dropping of loosened bark,
the stealthy tricklings of unseen rillets&mdash;all these
filled the forest with a sense of mysterious activity
and bustle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every little while Mart stopped to give the
floundering horse rest and encouragement. Jerry
belonged to Steve Doyle; but being a great pet
with his owner, and devoted to the child, and at
the same time somewhat too old to endure without
injury the hardships of winter lumbering, he
had been left at home in luxury the last two
winters, with nothing to do but make a weekly
trip to the camp on the Little St. Francis. In all
cases Jerry was treated with affectionate consideration,
which he amply repaid by his intelligence
and willingness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When our weary travellers reached the top of
the hill overlooking the camp, Jerry was pretty
well fagged. There was the camp, however, not
half a mile away in its clearing at the end of a
straight bit of road. Arty clapped his hands, and
stood up to see if he could catch a glimpse of his
father looking out for him; and Mart chirruped
cheerfully to the horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just at this moment the rain, which had been
threatening for hours, came down. It came down
in sheets. The horse was urged to a run; but
the travellers, ere they reached the camp, were
drenched as if they had fallen in the river. Arty,
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
moreover, was drenched in tears for a few moments
on learning of his father&rsquo;s absence; but
soon, with the delighted pettings and caressings
of the three or four woodsmen who had been left
in the camp, the little fellow&rsquo;s disappointment was
assuaged, and he was making himself at home.
The camp, however, seemed to him lonely and deserted;
and when, after supper, getting the cook
to wrap him up in an oilskin coat, he went out
to the stable to give Jerry a big piece of camp
gingerbread and bid him good-night, his disappointment
welled up again, and he gave way to a
few more tears on the affectionate animal&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Around the blazing fire a little later Arty was
himself again. The men sang songs for him, and
told him stories, and blew little clouds of bitter
smoke from their pipes into the brown thicket
of his curls. He sat now on one rough fellow&rsquo;s
knee, now on another&rsquo;s, and absorbed all the attention
of the camp, and was allowed by the cook to
eat all the gingerbread he wanted. When he got
sleepy he was put into his father&rsquo;s bunk; and,
since he was determined to have it so, Mart was
allowed to sleep beside him. Arty having gone
to bed, there was nothing for his admirers to do
but follow his example. Their hearts filled with
tender memories and generous thoughts, stirred
up by the presence of the child among them, the
backwoodsmen turned into their bunks, and soon
were fast asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;That night the floods came. The torrents rushing
down every hillside speedily burst the already
rotten ice. Some miles above the camp a jam
formed itself early in the evening,&mdash;a mixed mass
of ice-cakes, logs, and rubbish; and this kept the
water below from rising rapidly enough to warn
the camp of its danger. Just as the gray of dawn
was beginning to struggle dimly through the forest
aisles, the jam broke, and the mighty avalanche
of ice and water swept down on the slumbering
camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no warning. Men perished in their
sleep, crushed or drowned, without knowing what
had happened. The camp was simply wiped out
of existence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bunk in which Arty lay asleep with his
young protector was not built into the wall like
the other bunks. It was a separate structure, and
stood across the end of the building close by the
fireplace. When the flood struck the camp, the
stout building went down like a house of cards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a choking cry of terror Arty awoke to
find himself drifting in a tumult of icy waters.
Great dark waves kept whirling, eddying, and
crashing about him. An arm was around him,
holding him firmly, and he realized that Mart
was taking care of him. Presently a fragment of
wreck plunged against them and he heard Mart
groan; but the young man caught the timbers,
and bade Arty lay hold of them. The child
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
bravely did as he was told, and climbed actively
upon the floating mass. Hardly had he done so
when Mart disappeared under the dark surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shrill cry broke from Arty&rsquo;s lips at the
sight, but in a moment the young man reappeared.
He was close against the timbers&mdash;dashing
against them, in fact; but Arty saw that he
was unable to hold on to them. Throwing himself
flat on his face, the plucky little fellow caught
hold of his friend&rsquo;s sleeve, and clung to it with all
his tiny strength. Tiny as it was, it was enough
for the purpose, however, and Mart&rsquo;s head was
kept above water; but his eyes were closed, and
he did not notice the child&rsquo;s voice begging him
to climb up onto the wreck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The waters subsided almost as rapidly as they
had risen, though the stream remained a torrent,
raging far above its wonted bounds. In a few
minutes the timbers on which Arty had his refuge
were swung by an eddy into shallow water. They
caught against a tree, and then grounded at one end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arty began crawling toward shore, dragging
Mart&rsquo;s body through the water without great difficulty.
But when he got into the shallow part
it was another matter; he could not haul Mart&rsquo;s
weight any farther. Resting the young man&rsquo;s
head on the edge of the timbers, he paused to take
breath, and looked about him in despair. Now
he began to cry again; he had been too busy for
lamentations while trying to save Mart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;Presently he heard some one approaching, attracted
by the sound of his voice. Looking up
eagerly, he saw it was old Jerry, picking his way
through the shallow water. He called him by
name, and the horse neighed joyfully in answer.
The animal was sadly bedraggled in appearance,
but evidently unhurt. He had swum ashore lower
down the river, and was making his way back to
where he expected to find the camp. Now, however,
he came to Arty, sniffed him over, and
rubbed him with his soft, wet nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jerry&rsquo;ll help me pull Mart out,&rsquo; said the
child aloud, half to himself, half to the horse;
and laying hold of the young man&rsquo;s sleeve, he
again began bravely tugging upon it. &lsquo;Pull too,
Jerry,&rsquo; urged the little fellow, while the animal
stood wondering what it was he was required to
do. In a moment, however, he understood; and
seizing the young man by the collar of his shirt,
he speedily dragged him to land without much
help from Arty. The affectionate creature recognized
his driver, and stood over him with
drooping head, bewildered at his helplessness
and silence. Mart opened his eyes, and groaned
slightly once or twice, but immediately relapsed
into unconsciousness. Arty sat down by his side,
his little heart overflowing with grief and fear.
He kept crying for his father and his grandmother,
and for Mart to open his eyes. Jerry
completed the sad group, standing over it as if
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
on guard, and ever and anon lifting his head to
send forth a shrill whinny of appeal. This was
the position in which, a half-hour later, guided
by Jerry&rsquo;s signals, Steve Doyle and his party
found them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doyle had not caught the lumber thieves.
The march of his party had been so retarded by
the thaw that they had halted before going half-way.
As the storm increased, and they observed
how the water was rising in the brook beside which
they had encamped, they became alarmed. They
realized the prospect of a big flood; and Steve
Doyle led his men back in hot haste. It was
full daylight when they came out upon the devastated
clearing where once had stood the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horror in the lumbermen&rsquo;s hearts is not
to be described. In a pile of wreckage, strangely
mixed up with hay and straw from the stable,
they found the cook, with a leg and an arm
broken, but still alive. Of no one else was there
a sign, nor of the horses. From the cook, Doyle
learned of Arty&rsquo;s presence in the camp. Without
a word, but with a wild, white face, the man
started down stream in a despairing search; and
the whole band followed, with the exception of two
that stayed to take care of the unfortunate cook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the father clasped Arty in his arms
he was almost beside himself with joy for a few
moments; then he remembered the poor fellows
who were gone. Giving the child into the arms
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
of one of the men, he busied himself with Mart,
whom, by means of rubbing, he soon brought back
to consciousness. The brave fellow had been
stunned by a blow on the head, and afterward
half drowned; but he soon recovered so far as to
be able to walk with assistance. To Arty he owed
his life, even as he had himself saved Arty&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little later a melancholy procession started
back for Beardsley Settlement. The poor cook
was placed on Jerry&rsquo;s back, and bore his pain like
a hero. Arty trudged by the side of McCann, to
whose charge he was committed by his father, and
Mart was helped along by two of his comrades.
With these went five or six more of the hands, to
get them safely to the settlement. All the rest,
under the leadership of Steve Doyle, set off down
river on a search for the three missing men, or
their bodies. And the site of the camp was left
to its desolation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for Doyle&rsquo;s search, it proved fruitless, and
the party returned heavy-hearted. Henceforth the
scene of the catastrophe became known throughout
that region as &lsquo;Lost Camp,&rsquo; and was sedulously
avoided by the lumbermen. Next season
the Ryckert Company&rsquo;s camp on the Little St.
Francis was built on higher ground some miles
farther up stream.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a most depressing tale, Queerman,&rdquo;
grumbled Ranolf. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s my turn now;
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
and, thank goodness, I&rsquo;ve got something frivolous
to tell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heave ahead, then,&rdquo; urged Stranion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your title?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the tale of &lsquo;The Cart before the
Steer,&rsquo;&rdquo; replied Ranolf.</p>
<h3>THE CART BEFORE THE STEER.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Landry!&rsquo; shouted Squire Bateman, emerging
from the big red door of the barn with a
pitchfork in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Landry, an excitable little Frenchman, appeared
suddenly around the woodhouse, as if he
had just been waiting to be called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Landry,&rsquo; said the squire, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; in to
Kentville this mornin&rsquo; for that feed, ain&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, sare,&rsquo; responded Landry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The farmer considered for a moment, chewing
thoughtfully on a head of wheat. Then he continued,
&lsquo;You&rsquo;d better take the black-an&rsquo;-white
steer along, and leave him at Murphy&rsquo;s as you
pass. He&rsquo;s fat now as he&rsquo;ll ever be, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s jest a
waste o&rsquo; feed to keep on stuffin&rsquo; the critter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Ow&rsquo;ll I take him, sare?&rsquo; queried Landry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; replied the squire rather impatiently,
turning back into the barn, &lsquo;hitch him to the
back o&rsquo; the cart. He&rsquo;ll lead all right!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On this point Landry seemed doubtful. He
scratched his head anxiously for a moment, and
then darted off in his nervous way, so unlike the
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
deliberateness of hired men in general, to carry
out his employer&rsquo;s orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The black-and-white steer was a raw-boned
beast, about three years old, with no disposition
to take on fat. There was a wild, roving expression
in his eye which made Landry, who knew
cattle well, and appreciated the differences in
their dispositions, very doubtful as to his docility
when being led to market. In Squire Bateman&rsquo;s
eyes, however, a steer was a steer; and if one
could be led so could another. Squire Bateman
had a constitutional hatred of exceptions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Landry was ready to start he hitched
the steer to the cart-tail with a strong halter, and
set out with misgivings. But the steer proved
docility itself. It trotted along in indolent good
humor, holding its head high, and sniffing the
fresh, meadow-scented air with delight. By the
time they reached the top of Barnes&rsquo;s Hill, a long
descent about two miles this side of Kentville,
Landry had made up his mind that he had done
the animal an injustice. But just at this stage in
the journey something took place, as things will
so long as Fate remains the whimsical creature
she is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It chanced that a party of wheelmen from Halifax,
on a tour through the Cornwallis valley and
the Evangeline regions, arrived at the top of the
hill when Landry and his charge were about half-way
down. The bicyclists were riding in a long
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
line, single file. Their leader knew the country,
and he knew that Barnes&rsquo;s Hill was smooth and
safe for &lsquo;coasting.&rsquo; Some of the riders, the
leader among them, were on the old-fashioned
high wheels, while others rode the less conspicuous
&lsquo;Safeties,&rsquo; then a new thing. Each man, as
he dipped over the edge of the slope, flung his
legs over the handles and luxuriously &lsquo;let her
go.&rsquo; They saw the team ahead, but there was
abundance of room for safe passing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Squire Bateman&rsquo;s black-and-white steer
had been brought up behind the Gaspereau hills,
where the wheelman delights not to wander. A
bicycle, therefore, was in his eyes a novel and terrifying
sight. As the whirling and gleaming
apparition flashed past he snorted fiercely, and
sprang aside with a violence that almost upset
the cart. Landry sprang to his feet, grinding his
teeth with excitement and wrath, and the next
wheelman slipped radiantly by. This was too
much for the black-and-white steer, and on the
third wheel he made a desperate but ineffectual
charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ineffectual did I say? Well, only so far as
that wheel was concerned; but he flung himself
so far across the way that the next rider could
not avoid the obstacle. The tall wheel struck
the animal amidships, so to speak; and the rider
went right on and landed in a dismal heap. The
other riders darted aside up the bank into the
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
fence, stopping themselves gracefully or ungracefully,
but at any cost avoiding the now quite
demented beast that was blocking their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The animal made a frantic dash at the unfortunate
wheelman in the gutter, who had picked himself
up with difficulty, and was feeling for broken
bones. He was beyond the steer&rsquo;s reach, but discreetly
hobbled to the fence, and placed that welcome
barrier between him and the foe. The fury
of the animal&rsquo;s charge, however, had swung the
cart right across the road, and now the frightened
horse began to plunge and rear. Landry held him
in partial control; and the next instant the steer
made a second mad rush, this time aiming at the
bicycle which had struck him, and which now lay
in the gutter. He reached the offending wheel,
but at the same time he upset the cart. Out
went Landry like a rubber ball; and the horse,
kicking himself free of the traces, set out at a
highly creditable pace for Kentville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rage of the little Frenchman, as he picked
himself up, was Homeric. He abused the bellowing
and bounding brute with an eloquence which,
had it been expressed in English, would have
made the wheelmen on the other side of the fence
depart in horror. Then he seized a fence stake
and rushed into close quarters, resolved to enforce
his authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the moment of Landry&rsquo;s attack, the steer
had his horns very much engaged in the wheel of
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
the bicycle. As the fence stake came down with
impressive emphasis across his haunches, he tossed
the machine in air, and charged on his assailant
with great nimbleness and ferocity. Landry just
escaped by springing over the body of the cart;
and at this juncture he congratulated himself that
he had hitched the animal by so strong a halter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time the bicyclists had reunited their
forces a little below. Their leader, with the dismounted
wheelman, now came to rescue the suffering
wheel. But there was no such thing as
getting near it. The steer stood guard over his
prize with an air that forbade any interference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t much good now, anyway,&rsquo; grumbled
the victim. &lsquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll have to hobble on as
far as Kentville, and borrow or hire another wheel
there. This ain&rsquo;t worth mending now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, nonsense!&rsquo; replied the leader; &lsquo;a few dollars
will put it all right. We&rsquo;ll leave it at Kentville
to be sent back to Halifax by the D. A. R.,
and McInerney&rsquo;ll fix it so you&rsquo;d never know it
had been broken!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; rejoined the discomfited one, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
see how we&rsquo;re going to get hold of it, anyway.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To this sentiment the steer bellowed his adherence.
The leader of the wheelmen, however,
glancing around at the encouraging countenances
of his party, drew a small revolver from his hip
pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rsquo; he said, addressing Landry,
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
&lsquo;we ought to shoot this beast? He is blocking
the highway, and he is a menace to all passers-by.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The astute Landry meditated for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What might be your name, sare?&rsquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My name&rsquo;s Vroot&mdash;Walter Vroot of Halifax,&rsquo;
replied the wheelman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Eef you shoot ze steer, sare, Squire Bateman
he make you pay for &rsquo;eem, sure,&rsquo; said Landry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this there arose a chorus of indignation led
by the discomfited one. But Mr. Vroot turned
on his heel, thrusting his revolver back into his
pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said he to Landry, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll be so good
as to bring the bicycle into Kentville with you
when you come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sare,&rsquo; said Landry, &lsquo;&rsquo;ow is dat posseeble? I
go in to Kentville right now to look after my
&rsquo;orse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few minutes the wheelmen had vanished
in a slender and gleaming line, Landry and the
wheelless one (whose name, by the way, was
Smith) were tramping dejectedly townward, and
the steer was left in absolute possession of the
cart, the wheel, and a portion of the Queen&rsquo;s
highway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a short time the situation might have become
monotonous for the animal, as the road was
dry and dusty, and the rich, short grass of the
roadside beyond his reach. But just as he had
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
got tired of demolishing the bicycle, there came
a diversion. A light carriage containing a lady
and gentleman appeared over the crest of the
hill. The occupants of the carriage were surprised
and vexed at the obstacle before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I think it&rsquo;s perfectly outrageous,&rsquo; said the
lady, &lsquo;the way these country people leave their
vehicles right in the middle of the road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There seems to have been some accident,&rsquo;
remarked the man soothingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What business had they going away and leaving
things that way?&rsquo; retorted the lady sharply.
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have to get out and remove that animal
before we try to pass.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time the horse, a mild livery-stable
creature, was almost within reach of the angry
steer, whose tail twitched ominously. The next
instant, with a deep, grunting bellow, he charged
at the horse, who reared and backed just in time
to save himself. The carriage came within an ace
of upsetting, and the lady shrieked hysterically.
The man sprang out, and seized the horse by the
head. The lady flung herself out desperately
over the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, my dear!&rsquo; said the man.
&lsquo;The animal is securely fastened to the cart, and
seems to have been placed there to guard the
way. They seem to have very strange customs
in Nova Scotia!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What <i>shall</i> we do?&rsquo; queried the lady tearfully,
gazing at the pawing and roaring steer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, there&rsquo;s nothing to do but take down a
piece of the fence and drive around. There&rsquo;s no
occasion for alarm!&rsquo; replied the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He backed the horse a little way, and then
tied him to the fence while he made an opening.
Then he made another opening at a safe distance
below the obstacle, led the horse and carriage
through, put the lady back into the seat, and continued
his journey philosophically. In the course
of the next hour a number of other travellers approached,
and taking in the situation, followed
the new route through the fields. The steer invariably
bellowed, and plunged and lashed himself
into mad rage in trying to get at them; but
Squire Bateman&rsquo;s halter and rope did their duty,
and all his efforts proved futile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But meanwhile the most astounding reports
were flying about Kentville. Landry had secured
the horse, and related the exact truth of the whole
affair; but the various romantic and exciting embellishments
of wayfarers found most favor in the
eventless country town. A little squad of men
with guns set forth to quell the nuisance; and
hard on their heels followed Landry, bent on saving
the property of his employer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the party drew near, and realized how
securely their antagonist was tethered, they were
in no haste to complete their errand. The brute&rsquo;s
rage was so blind and fierce that they amused
themselves for a little with the sport of tantalizing
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
him. They would approach almost within
his reach, and then dart back to a safer-looking
distance; and presently the animal was a mass of
sweat and froth, churned with red dust of the
highway. At last, just as one of the men raised
his rifle with the intention of ending the play,
the animal threw himself in one of his maddest
charges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Landry had just come up. The instant the
steer fell he rushed forward, threw his coat over
its head, and knotted the arms under its jaws.
Breathless and bewildered, the panting brute
ceased its struggles and lay quite still. In a
moment or two it was lifted to its feet, the halter
was unhitched from the cart-tail, and Landry set
out for Kentville with the blindfolded steer following
as gently as a lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">MORE OF CAMP DE SQUATOOK.</span></h2>
<p>On the following morning we breakfasted in a
very leisurely fashion, with a delightful sense of
having all day before us. We spent the day in
casting our flies at the outlet, and our success was
a continual repetition of that of the previous
night. Only Stranion grew tired. He could not
hook as many fish as the rest of us; wherefore he
grew disgusted, and chose to sit on the bank deriding
us. But as long as the fish were feeding
we heeded him not. Our heaviest trout that day
just cleared two pounds and a half.</p>
<p>In the evening we took tea early. Before settling
down we made a little voyage of exploration
to the top of a neighboring hill, and watched the
moon rise over the vast and empty wilderness.
Returning to the camp, we doffed our scanty garments,
ran down the beach, and dashed out into
the gleaming lake-waters. It was such a swim as
Stranion had told us of. After this we felt royally
luxurious. We lolled upon our blankets with a
lordly air, and the soughing of the pines was all
about us for music. Then, in a peremptory tone,
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
Sam cried, &ldquo;Stranion!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Sir, to you!&rdquo; was
Stranion&rsquo;s polite response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stranion,&rdquo; continued Sam, &ldquo;to you it falls to
unfold to this appreciative audience the resources
of your experience or your imagination. I would
recommend, now, a judicious combination of the
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus irresistibly adjured, Stranion began:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the story of&mdash;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;LOU&rsquo;S CLARIONET,&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p>said he. &ldquo;Judge ye whether I speak from experience
or imagination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a Christmas Eve service in the Second
Westcock Church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The church at Second Westcock was quaint
and old-fashioned, like the village over which it
presided. Its shingles were gray with the beating
of many winters; its little square tower was surmounted
by four spindling posts, like the legs
of a table turned heavenward; its staring windows
were adorned with curtains of yellow cotton;
its uneven and desolate churchyard, strewn with
graves and snowdrifts, occupied a bleak hillside
looking out across the bay to the lonely height
of Shepody Mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down the long slope below the church straggled
the village, half-lost in the snow, and whistled
over by the winds of the Bay of Fundy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second Westcock was an outlying corner of
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
the rector&rsquo;s expansive parish, and a Christmas Eve
service there was an event almost unparalleled.
To give Second Westcock this service, the rector
had forsaken his prosperous congregations at Westcock,
Sackville, and Dorchester, driving some eight
or ten miles through the snows and solitude of the
deep Dorchester woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And because the choir at Second Westcock
was not remarkable even for willingness, much
less for strength or skill, he had brought with
him his fifteen-year-old niece, Lou Allison, to
swell the Christmas praises with the notes of
her clarionet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little church was lighted with oil-lamps
ranged along the white wall between the windows.
The poor, bare chancel&mdash;a red cloth-covered
kitchen table in a semicircle of paintless
railing&mdash;was flanked by two towering pulpits of
white pine. On either side the narrow, carpetless
aisle were rows of unpainted benches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the left were gathered solemnly the men
of the congregation, each looking straight ahead.
On the right were the women, whispering and
scanning each other&rsquo;s bonnets, till the appearance
of the rector from the little vestry-room by the
door should bring silence and reverent attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In front of the women&rsquo;s row stood the melodeon;
and the two benches behind it were occupied
by the choir, the male members of which sat
blushingly self-conscious, proud of their office, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
deeply abashed at the necessity of sitting among
the women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no attempt at Christmas decoration,
for Second Westcock had never been awakened to
the delicious excitements of the church greening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last the rector appeared in his voluminous
white surplice. He moved slowly up the aisle,
and mounted the winding steps of the right-hand
pulpit; and as he did so his five-year-old son, forsaking
his place by Lou&rsquo;s side, marched forward
and seated himself resolutely on the pulpit steps.
He did not feel quite at home in Second Westcock
Church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sweet old carol, &lsquo;While shepherds watched
their flocks by night,&rsquo; rose rather doubtfully from
the little choir, who looked and listened askance
at the glittering clarionet, into which Lou was
now blowing softly. Lou was afraid to make herself
distinctly heard at first, lest she should startle
the singers; but in the second verse the pure
vibrant notes came out with confidence, and then
for two lines the song was little more than a duet
between Lou and the rector&rsquo;s vigorous baritone.
In the third verse, however, it all came right.
The choir felt and responded to the strong support
and thrilling stimulus of the instrument, and
at length ceased to dread their own voices. The
naked little church was glorified with the sweep
of triumphal song pulsating through it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never before had such music been heard there.
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
Men, women, and children sang from their very
souls; and when the hymn was ended the whole
congregation stood for some seconds as in a dream,
with quivering throats, till the rector&rsquo;s calm voice,
repeating the opening words of the liturgy, brought
back their self-control in some measure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thereafter every hymn and chant and carol
was like an inspiration, and Lou&rsquo;s eyes sparkled
with exultation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the service was over the people gathered
round the stove by the door, praising Lou&rsquo;s
clarionet, and petting little Ted, who had by this
time come down from the pulpit steps. One old
lady gave the child two or three brown sugar-biscuits,
which she had brought in her pocket,
and a pair of red mittens, which she had knitted
for him as a Christmas present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turning to Lou, the old lady said, &lsquo;I never
heerd nothing like that trumpet of yourn, Miss.
I felt like it jest drawed down the angels from
heaven to sing with us to-night. Ther voices was
all swimming in a smoke like, right up in the
hollow of the ceiling.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t a trumpet!&rsquo; interrupted Teddy shyly;
&lsquo;it&rsquo;s a clar&rsquo;onet. I got a trumpet home!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>To</i> be sure!&rsquo; replied the old lady indulgently.
&lsquo;But, Miss, as I was a-sayin&rsquo;, that music
of yourn would jest soften the hardest heart as
ever was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rector had just come from the vestry-room,
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
well wrapped up in his furs, and was
shaking hands and wishing every one a Merry
Christmas, while the sexton brought the horse to
the door. He overheard the old lady&rsquo;s last remark,
as she was bundling Teddy up in a huge
woollen muffler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It certainly did,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;make the singing
go magnificently to-night, didn&rsquo;t it, Mrs. Tait?
But I wonder, now, what sort of an effect it
would produce on a hard-hearted bear if such
a creature should come out at us while we are
going through Dorchester woods?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mild pleasantry was very delicately
adapted to the rector&rsquo;s audience, and the group
about the stove smiled with a reverent air befitting
the place they were in; but the old lady
exclaimed in haste,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My land sakes, Parson, a bear&rsquo;d be jest scared
to death!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wonder if it <i>would</i> frighten a bear?&rsquo;
thought Lou to herself, as they were getting
snugly bundled into the warm, deep &lsquo;pung,&rsquo; as
the low box-sleigh with movable seats is called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon the crest of the hill was passed, and
the four-poster on the top of Second Westcock
Church sank out of sight. For a mile or more
the road led through half-cleared pasture lands,
where the black stumps stuck up so strangely
through the drifts that Teddy discovered bears
on every hand. He was not at all alarmed, however,
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
for he was sure his father was a match for
a thousand bears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By and by the road entered the curious inverted
dark of the Dorchester woods, where all
the light seemed to come from the white snow
under the trees rather than from the dark sky
above them. At this stage of the journey Teddy
retired beneath the buffalo-robes, and went to
sleep in the bottom of the pung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horse jogged slowly along the somewhat
heavy road. The bells jingled drowsily amid the
soft, pushing whisper of the runners. Lou and
the rector talked in quiet voices, attuned to the
solemn hush of the great forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>What&rsquo;s that?</i>&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou shivered up closer to the rector as she
spoke, and glanced nervously into the dark woods
whence a sound had come. He did not answer
at once, but seized the whip and tightened the
reins, as a signal to old Jerry to move on faster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horse needed no signal, but awoke into
an eager trot, which would have become a gallop
had the rector permitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again came the sound, this time a little
nearer, and still, apparently, just abreast of the
pung, but deep in the woods. It was a bitter,
long, wailing cry, blended with a harshly grating
undertone, like the rasping of a saw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; again asked Lou, her teeth
chattering.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;The rector let old Jerry out into a gallop, as
he answered, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s a panther,&mdash;what
they call around here an &ldquo;Indian devil.&rdquo; But I
don&rsquo;t think there is any real danger. It is a
ferocious beast, but will probably give <i>us</i> a wide
berth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why won&rsquo;t it attack <i>us</i>?&rdquo; asked Lou.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, it prefers solitary victims,&rsquo; replied the
rector. &lsquo;It is ordinarily a cautious beast, and does
not understand the combination of man and horse
and vehicle. Only on rare occasions has it been
known to attack people driving, and this one
will probably keep well out of our sight. However,
it&rsquo;s just as well to get beyond its neighborhood
as quickly as possible. Steady, Jerry, old
boy! Steady; don&rsquo;t use yourself up too fast!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rector kept the horse well in hand; but
in a short time it was plain that the panther was
not avoiding the party. The cries came nearer
and nearer, and Lou&rsquo;s breath came quicker and
quicker, and the rector&rsquo;s teeth began to set themselves
grimly, while his brows gathered in anxious
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it should come to a struggle, what was
there in the sleigh, he was wondering, that could
serve as a weapon? Nothing, absolutely nothing,
but his heavy pocket-knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A poor weapon,&rsquo; thought he ruefully, &lsquo;with
which to fight a panther.&rsquo; But he felt in his
pocket with one hand, and opened the knife, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
slipped it under the edge of the cushion beside
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this instant he caught sight of the panther
bounding along through the low underbrush,
keeping parallel with the road, and not forty
yards away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There it is!&rsquo; came in a terrified whisper
from Lou&rsquo;s lips; and just then Teddy lifted his
head from under the robes. Frightened at the
speed, and at the set look on his father&rsquo;s face, he
began to cry. The panther heard him and turned
at once toward the sleigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Jerry stretched himself out in a burst of
extra speed, while the rector grasped his poor
knife fiercely; and the panther came with a long
leap right into the road, not ten paces behind
the flying sleigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teddy stared in amazement, then cowered
down in fresh terror as there came an ear-splitting
screech, wild and high and long, from Lou&rsquo;s
clarionet. Lou had turned, and over the back of
the seat was blowing this peal of desperate defiance
in the brute&rsquo;s very face. The astonished
animal shrank back in his tracks, and sprang
again into the underbrush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou turned to the rector with a flushed face
of triumph, and the rector exclaimed in a husky
voice, &lsquo;Thank God!&rsquo; But Teddy, between his
sobs, complained, &lsquo;What did you do that for,
Lou?&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lou jumped to the conclusion that her victory
was complete and final; but the rector kept Jerry
at his top speed, and scrutinized the underwood
apprehensively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The panther appeared again in four or five
minutes, returning to the road, and leaping along
some forty or fifty feet behind the sleigh. His
pace was a very curious, disjointed, india-rubbery
spring, which rapidly closed up on the fugitives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then round swung Lou&rsquo;s long instrument
again, and at its piercing cry the animal again
shrank back. This time, however, he kept to the
road, and the moment Lou paused for breath he
resumed the chase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Save your breath, child,&rsquo; exclaimed the rector,
as Lou again put the slender tube to her lips.
&lsquo;Save your breath, and let him have it ferociously
when he begins to get too near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The animal came within twenty or thirty feet
again, and then Lou greeted him with an ear-splitting
blast, and he fell back. Again and again
the tactics were repeated. Lou tried a thrilling
cadenza; it was too much for the brute&rsquo;s nerves.
He could not comprehend a girl with such a penetrating
voice, and he could not screw up his courage
to a closer investigation of the marvel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last the animal seemed to resolve on a
change of procedure. Plunging into the woods,
he made an effort to get ahead of the sleigh. Old
Jerry was showing signs of exhaustion; but the
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
rector roused him to an extra spurt&mdash;and there, just
ahead, was the opening of Fillmore&rsquo;s settlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Blow, Lou, blow!&rsquo; shouted the rector; and
as the panther made a dash to intercept the sleigh,
it found itself in too close proximity to the strange-voiced
phenomenon in the pung, and sprang backward
with an angry snarl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Lou&rsquo;s breath failed from her dry lips, the
sleigh dashed out into the open. A dog bayed
angrily from the nearest farmhouse, and the panther
stopped short on the edge of the wood. The
rector drove into the farmyard; and old Jerry
stopped, shivering as if he would fall between
the shafts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the story had been told, and Jerry had
been stabled and rubbed down, the rector resumed
his journey with a fresh horse, having no fear that
the panther would venture across the cleared
lands. Three of the settlers started out forthwith,
and following the tracks in the new snow,
succeeded in shooting the beast after a chase of
two or three hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The adventure supplied the country-side all
that winter with a theme for conversation; and
about Lou&rsquo;s clarionet there gathered a halo of
romance that drew rousing congregations to the
parish church, where its music was to be heard
every alternate Sunday evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;I should say,&rdquo; remarked Queerman, &ldquo;that to
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
experience and imagination you combine a most
tenacious memory. Who would have dreamed
that the shy Teddy, with his proclivity for the
pulpit-steps, would have developed into the
Stranion that we see before us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this there was no reply. Then suddenly
Magnus said, &ldquo;Sam!&rdquo; And Sam began at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all about&mdash;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;JAKE DIMBALL&rsquo;S WOODEN LEG,&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p>said Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One evening in the early summer, I won&rsquo;t
say how many years ago, Jake Dimball was
driving the cows home from pasture. At that
time Jake, a stout youth of seventeen, had no
thought of such an appendage as a wooden leg.
Indeed, he had no place to put one had he possessed
such a thing; for his own vigorous legs of
bone and muscle, with which he had been born and
with which he had grown up in entire content,
seemed likely to serve him for the rest of his natural
life. But that very evening, amid the safe
quiet and soft colors of the upland cow-pasture,
fate was making ready a lesson for him in the possibilities
of the unexpected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Westmoreland county that summer bears
were looked upon as a drug in the market. The
county, indeed, seemed to be suffering from an
epidemic of bears. But, so far, these woody pastures
of Second Westcock, surrounded by settlements,
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
had apparently escaped the contagion.
When, therefore, Jake was startled by an angry
growl, coming from a swampy thicket on his right,
the thought of a bear did not immediately occur to
him. He saw that the cows were running ahead
with a sudden alertness, but he paused and gazed
at the thicket, wondering whether it would be wise
for him to go and investigate the source of the
sound. While he hesitated, the question was decided
for him. A large black bear burst forth
from the bushes with a crash that carried a nameless
terror into Jake&rsquo;s very soul. The beast looked
so cruelly out of place, so horribly out of place,
breaking in upon the beauty and security of the
familiar scene. Jake had no weapon more formidable
than the hazel switch he was carrying and
the pocket-knife with which he was trimming off
its branches. After one long horrified look at
the bear, Jake took to flight along the narrow
cow-path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake was a notable runner in those days, yet
the bear gained upon him rapidly. The cow-path
was tortuous exceedingly, and away from the path
the ground was too rough for fast running&mdash;at
least Jake found it so. The bear did not seem to
mind the irregularities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake envied the cows their fine head start.
He wished he was with them; then, as he heard
the bear getting closer, he almost wished he was
one of them; and then his foot caught in a root
and he fell headlong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;As he fell a great wave of despair went over
him, and a thought flashed through his mind:
&lsquo;This is the end of me!&rsquo; His sight was darkened
for an instant, as he rolled in the moss
and twigs between two hillocks. Then, turning
upon his back, he saw the bear already hanging
over him; and now a desperate courage came to
his aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Raising his heels high in the air, he brought
them down with violence in the brute&rsquo;s face. The
animal started back, astonished at this novel method
of defence. When it advanced again to the attack,
Jake met it desperately with his heels; and
all the time he kept up a lusty shouting such as he
hoped would soon bring some one to the rescue.
For a few minutes, strange to say, Jake&rsquo;s tactics
were successful in keeping his foe at bay; but
presently the bear, growing more angry, or more
hungry, made a fiercer assault, and, succeeded in
catching the lad&rsquo;s foot between his jaws. The
brave fellow sickened under the cruel grip of
those crunching teeth; but he kept up the fight
with his free heel. Just as he was about fainting
with pain and exhaustion, some farmers, who had
heard the outcry, arrived upon the scene, and
the bear hastily withdrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That night there was a bear-hunt at Second
Westcock, but it brought no spoils. Bruin had
made an effective disappearance. As for Jake,
his foot and the lower part of his leg were so
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
dreadfully mangled that the leg had to be cut off
just below the knee. When the lad was entirely
recovered, being a handy fellow, he made himself
a new leg of white oak, around the bottom of
which, to prevent wear, he hammered a stout iron
ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The years went by in their usual surreptitious
fashion, and brought few changes to Second Westcock.
One June evening, ten years after that on
which my story opened, Jake was driving the cows
home as usual, when once more, as he passed the
swampy thicket, he heard that menacing growl.
Jake looked about him as if in a dream. There
was the same dewy smell in the air, mingled with
the fragrance of sweet fern, that he remembered
so painfully and so well. There was the same long
yellow cloud over the black woods to the west.
There was the same dappled sky of amber and
violet over his head. As before, he saw the cows
breaking into a run. In a moment there was the
same dreadful crashing in the thicket. Was he
dreaming? He looked down in bewilderment, and
his eyes fell on the iron-shod end of his wooden
leg! That settled it. Evidently he was not
dreaming, and it was time for him to hurry home.
He broke into a run as rapid as his wooden leg
would allow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, long use and natural dexterity had
made Jake almost as active in the handling of
this wooden leg as most men are with the limbs
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
which nature gave them. But with his original
legs in their pristine vigor he had found himself
no match for a bear. What, then, could he expect
in the present instance? Jake looked over his
shoulder, and beheld the bear hot on his tracks.
He could have sworn it was the same bear as of
old. He made up his mind to run no more, but
to save his breath for what he felt might be his
last fight. He gave a series of terrific yells, such
as he thought might pierce even to the corner
grocery under the hill, and threw himself flat on
his back on a gentle hummock that might pass for
a post of vantage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake was not hopeful, but he was firm. He
thought it would be too much to expect to come
off twice victorious from a scrape like this. He
eyed the bear sternly, and it seemed to him as if
the brute actually smiled on observing that its
intended victim had not forgotten his ancient
tactics. Jake concluded that the approaching
contest was likely to be fatal to himself, but he
calculated on making it at least unpleasant for
the bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The animal turned a little to one side, and
attacked his prostrate antagonist in the flank; but
Jake whirled nimbly just in time, and brought
down his iron-shod heel on the brute&rsquo;s snout.
The blow was a heavy one, but that bear was not
at all surprised. If it was the bear of the previous
encounter, it doubtless argued that years
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
had brought additional weight and strength to
its opponent&rsquo;s understanding. It was not to be
daunted, but instantly seized the wooden leg in
its angry jaws. Jake&rsquo;s yells for help continued;
but the bear, the moment it discovered that the
limb on which it was chewing was of good white
oak, fell a prey to astonishment, if not alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It dropped the leg, backed off a few paces,
sat down upon its haunches, and gazed at this
strange and inedible species of man. Jake realized
at once the creature&rsquo;s bewilderment; but the
crisis was such a painful one that the humor of
the situation failed to strike him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a few moments of contemplation, the
bear made a fresh attack. It was hungry, and
perhaps thought some other portion of Jake&rsquo;s
body might prove more delicate eating than his
leg. Jake, however, gave it no chance to try.
The next hold the bear got was upon the very
end of the oaken member, where the iron ring
proved little to its taste. It tried fiercely for
another hold; but Jake in his desperate struggles,
endowed with the strength of his terror, succeeded
in foiling it in every attempt. At length,
with the utmost force of his powerful thigh, he
drove the end of the leg right into the beast&rsquo;s
open mouth, inflicting a serious wound. Blood
flowed freely from the animal&rsquo;s throat; and presently,
after a moment of hesitation, having probably
concluded that the morsel was not savory
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
enough to justify any further struggle, the bear
moved sullenly away, coughing and whining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake lay quite still till his vanquished antagonist
had disappeared in the covert. Then he
rose and wended his way homeward, thinking
to himself how much better his wooden leg had
served him than an ordinary one could have done.
In a few minutes he was met by some of his
fellow-townsmen, who were hastening to find out
the cause of all the noise. To them Jake related
the adventure with great elation, adding, as he
concluded, &lsquo;You see, now, how everything turns
out for the best. If I hadn&rsquo;t lost that ere leg of
mine this night ten year ago, I&rsquo;d have mebbe lost
my head this very evening!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In spite of Jake Dimball&rsquo;s reputation for truthfulness,
his story was not believed in the village
of Second Westcock. It was voted altogether too
improbable, from whatever side it was looked at.
In fact, so profoundly incredulous were his fellow-villagers,
that Jake could not even organize a bear-hunt.
Some ten days later, however, his veracity
received ample confirmation. A man out looking
for strayed cattle in the woods not more than a
couple of miles from Jake&rsquo;s pasture, found a large
bear lying dead in a cedar swamp. Examining
the body curiously to find the cause of death, he
was puzzled till he recalled Jake&rsquo;s story. Then
he looked at the dead brute&rsquo;s throat. The mystery
was solved; and the community was once for
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
all convinced of the fighting qualities of the wooden
leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good story,&rdquo; said Magnus. &ldquo;In a
vague way it reminds me of one which is as unlike
it as anything could well be. Mine is a tropical
tale. Let the O. M. enter it as&mdash;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;PERIL AMONG THE PEARLS.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>I got it at first-hand when I was in Halifax
last autumn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the tiny office of the &lsquo;Cunarder&rsquo; inn the
air was thick with smoke. The white, egg-shaped
stove contained a fire, though September was yet
young; for a raw night fog had rolled in over
Halifax, making the display of bright coals no
less comforting than cheerful. From the adjacent
wharves came the soft washing and whispering
of the tide, with an occasional rattle of oars as
a boat came to land from one of the many ships.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The density of the atmosphere in the office
was chiefly due to &lsquo;Al&rsquo; Johnson, the diver, who,
when he was not talking, diving, eating, or sleeping,
was sure to be puffing at his pipe. We had
talked little, but now I resolved to turn off the
smoke flowing from Johnson&rsquo;s pipe by getting
him to tell us a story. He could never tell a
story and keep his pipe lit at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnson was a college-bred man, whom a love
of adventure had lured into deep-sea diving. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
and his partner were at this time engaged in recovering
the cargo of the steamer Oelrich, sunk
near the entrance to Halifax harbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked Johnson, &lsquo;Do you remember promising
me a yarn about an adventure you had in
the pearl-fisheries?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Which adventure? and what pearl-fisheries?&rsquo;
Johnson asked. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve fished at Tinnevelli, and in
the Sulu waters off the Borneo coast, and also
in the Torres Strait; and wheresoever it was, there
seemed to be pretty nearly always some excitement
going.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;whichever you like to give us.
I think what you spoke of was an adventure in
the Torres Strait.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Johnson, &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;ll give you a
little yarn about a tussle I had with a turtle in
the Sulu waters. I fancy there isn&rsquo;t much that
grows but you&rsquo;ll find it somewhere in Borneo; and
the water there is just as full of life as the land.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sharks?&rsquo; I queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, worse than sharks!&rsquo; replied Johnson.
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a big squid that will squirt the water
black as ink; and just then, perhaps, something
comes along and grabs you when you can&rsquo;t defend
yourself. And there&rsquo;s the devil-fish, own cousin
to the squid, and the meanest enemy you&rsquo;d want
to run across anywhere. And there&rsquo;s a tremendous
giant of a shell-fish,&mdash;a kind of scalloped
clam, that lies with its huge shells wide open, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
half hidden in the long weeds and sea-mosses. If
you put your foot into <i>that</i> trap&mdash;<i>snap!</i> it closes
on you, and you&rsquo;re fast! That clam is a good
deal stronger than you are; and if you have not
a hatchet or something to smash the shell with,
you are likely to stay there. Of course your
partner in the boat up aloft would soon know
something was wrong, finding that he couldn&rsquo;t
haul you up. Then he would go down after you,
and chop you loose perhaps. But meanwhile it
would be far from nice, especially if a shark came
along&mdash;if another clam does not nab him, for one
of these big clams has been known to catch even
a shark. Many natives thereabouts do a lot of
diving on their own account, and, of course, don&rsquo;t
indulge in diving-suits. I can tell you, they are
very careful not to fall afoul of those clam-shells;
for when they do they&rsquo;re drowned before they can
get clear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You can hardly blame the clam, or whatever
it is,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;It must be rather a shock to its
nerves when it feels a big foot thrust down right
upon its stomach!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; assented Johnson; &lsquo;you can&rsquo;t blame the
clam. But besides the clam, there is a big turtle
that is a most officious creature, with a beak that
will almost cut railroad iron. It is forever poking
that beak into whatever it thinks it doesn&rsquo;t know
all about; and you cannot scare it as you can a
shark. You have simply got to kill it before it
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
will acknowledge itself beaten. These same turtles,
however, at the top of the water or on dry
land would, in most cases, prove as timid as rabbits.
And then, as you say, there are the sharks,&mdash;all
kinds, big and little, forever hungry, but not
half so courageous as they get the credit of being.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I suppose,&rsquo; I interrupted, &lsquo;you always carried
a weapon of some sort!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, rather!&rsquo; said Johnson. &lsquo;For my own
part, I took a great fancy to the ironwood stakes
that the natives always use. But they didn&rsquo;t
seem to me quite the thing for smashing those
big shells with, supposing a fellow should happen
to put his foot into one. So I made myself a
stake with a steel top, which answered every purpose.
More than one big shark have I settled
with that handspike of mine; and once I found,
to my great advantage, that it was just the thing
to break up a shell with.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ha, ha!&rsquo; laughed Best, who had been listening
rather inattentively hitherto. &lsquo;So <i>you</i> put
your foot in it, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, I did,&rsquo; said Johnson. &lsquo;And that is just
what I&rsquo;m going to tell you about. I was working
that season with a good partner, a likely young
fellow hailing from Auckland. He tended the
line and the pump to my complete satisfaction.
I&rsquo;ve never had a better tender. Also, I was teaching
him to dive, and he took to it like a loon.
His name was &ldquo;Larry&rdquo; Scott; and if he had lived,
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
he would have made a record. He was killed
about a year after the time I&rsquo;m telling you of, in
a row down in New Orleans. But we won&rsquo;t stop
to talk about that now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As I was saying, Larry and I pulled together
pretty well from the start, and we were so lucky
with our fishing that the fellows in the other boats
began to get jealous and unpleasant. You must
know that all kinds go to the pearl-fisheries; and
the worst kinds have rather the best of it, in point
of numbers. We were ready enough to fight, but
we liked best to go our own way peaceably. So,
when some of the other lads got quarrelsome, we
just smiled, hoisted our sail, and looked up a new
ground for ourselves some little distance from the
rest of the fleet. Luck being on our side just
then, we chanced upon one of the finest beds in
the whole neighborhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One morning, as I was poking about among
the seaweed and stuff, I came across a fine-looking
bunch of pearl-shells. I made a grab at them,
but they were firmly rooted and refused to come
away. I laid down my handspike, took hold of
the cluster with both hands, and shifted my foothold
so as to get a good chance to pull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Up came the bunch of shells at the first
wrench, much more readily than I had expected.
To recover myself I took a step backward; down
went my foot into a crevice, &ldquo;slumped&rdquo; into something
soft, and <i>snap!</i> my leg was fast in a grip
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
that almost made me yell there in the little prison
of my helmet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, as you may imagine, just as soon as I
recovered from the start this gave me, I reached
out for my handspike to knock that clam-shell
into flinders. But a cold shiver went over me
as I found I could not reach the weapon! As I
laid it down, it had slipped a little off to one side;
and there it rested about a foot out of my reach,
reclining on one of those twisted conch-shells such
as the farmers use for dinner-horns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How I jerked on my leg trying to pull it out
of the trap! That, however, only hurt the leg.
All the satisfaction I could get was in the thought
that my foot, with its big, twenty-pound, rubber-and-lead
boot, must be making the clam&rsquo;s internal
affairs rather uncomfortable. After I had pretty
well tired myself out, stretching and tugging on
my leg, and struggling to reach the handspike, I
paused to recover my wind, and consider the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was not very deep water I was working in,
and there was any amount of light. You have no
sort of idea, until you have been there yourself,
what a queer world it is down where the pearl-oyster
grows. The seaweeds were all sorts of
colors&mdash;or rather, I should say, they were all
sorts of reds and yellows and greens. The rest
of the colors of the rainbow you might find in the
shells which lay around under foot, or went crawling
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
among the weeds; and away overhead darted
and flashed the queerest looking fish, like birds
in a yellow sky. There were lots of big anemones
too, waving, stretching, and curling their
many-colored tentacles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I saw everything with extraordinary vividness
about that time, as I know by the clear way
I recollect it now; but you may be sure I wasn&rsquo;t
thinking much just then about the beauties of
nature. I was trying to think of some way of
getting assistance from Larry. At length I concluded
I had better give him the signal to haul
me up. Finding that I was stuck, he would, I
reasoned, hoist the anchor, and then pull the boat
along to the place of my captivity. Then he
could easily send me down a hatchet wherewith
to chop my way to freedom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just as I had come to this resolve, a black
shadow passed over my head, and I looked up
quickly. It was a big turtle. I didn&rsquo;t like this,
I can tell you; but I kept perfectly still, hoping
the new-comer would not notice me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He paddled along very slowly, with his queer
little head stuck far out, and presently he noticed
my air-tube. It seemed to strike him as decidedly
queer. My blood fairly turned to ice in my veins
as I saw him paddle up and take hold of it in
a gingerly fashion with his beak. Luckily, he
didn&rsquo;t seem to think it would be good to eat;
but I knew that if he should bite it I would be
a dead man in about a minute, drowned inside
my helmet like a rat in a hole. It is in an emergency
like this that a man learns to know what
real terror is.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/img006.jpg" alt="" width="561" height="800" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;<span class="sc">It seemed to strike Him as decidedly Queer.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Page 140.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In my desperation I stooped down and tore
with both hands at the shells and weeds for something
I might hurl at the turtle, thinking thus
perhaps to distract his attention from my air-tube.
But what do you suppose happened? Why, I
succeeded in pulling up a great lump of shells
and stones all bedded together. The mass was
fully two feet long. My heart gave a leap of
exultation, for I knew at once just what to do
with the instrument thus providentially placed in
my hands. Instead of trying to hurl it at the
turtle, I reached out with it, and managed to
scrape that precious handspike within grasp. As I
gathered it once more into my grip, I straightened
up and was a man again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just at this juncture the turtle decided to
take a hand in. I had given the signal to be
hauled up at the very moment when I got hold
of that lump of stones, and now I could feel
Larry tugging energetically on the rope. The
turtle left off fooling with the tube, and, paddling
down to see what was making such a commotion
in the water, he tackled me at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As it happened, however, he took hold of
the big copper nut on the top of the head-piece;
and that was too tough a morsel even for <i>his</i> beak,
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
so that all he could do was to shake me a bit.
With him at my head, and the clam on my leg,
and Larry jerking on my waistband, you may
imagine I could hardly call my soul my own.
However, I began jabbing my handspike for all
I was worth into the unprotected parts of the
turtle&rsquo;s body, feeling around for some vital spot,&mdash;which
is a thing mighty hard to find in a turtle!
In a moment the water was red with blood; but
that made no great difference to me, and for a
while it didn&rsquo;t seem to make much difference to
the turtle either. All I could do was to keep
on jabbing as close to the neck as I could, and
between the front flippers. And the turtle kept
on chewing at the copper joint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I believe it was the clam that helped me most
effectually in that struggle. You see, that grip
on my leg kept me as steady as a rock. If it
hadn&rsquo;t been for that, the turtle would have had
me off my feet and end over end in no time, and
would probably have soon got the best of me.
As it was, after a few moments of this desperate
stabbing with the handspike, I managed to kill
my assailant; but even in death that iron beak
of his maintained its hold on the copper nut of
my helmet. Having no means of cutting the
brute&rsquo;s head off, I turned my attention to the
big clam, and with the steel point of my handspike
I soon released my foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then Larry hauled me up. He told me afterward
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
he never in all his life got such a start as
when that great turtle came to the surface hanging
on to the top of my helmet. The creature
was so heavy he could not haul it and me together
into the boat; so he slashed the head off with
a hatchet, and then lifted me aboard. Beyond a
black-and-blue leg, I was not much the worse for
that adventure; but I was so used up with the excitement
of it all that I wouldn&rsquo;t go down for
any more pearls that day. We took a day off,&mdash;Larry
and I, and indulged in a little run ashore.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You had earned it,&rsquo; said I.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Now, Queerman,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;as your turn
comes round again, give us something less lugubrious
than your last. Be light; be cheerful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that I remember,&rdquo; replied
Queerman, &ldquo;a merry little adventure that befell
me some years ago. If it is not hilarious
enough to suit you, Sam, you can stop me in the
middle of it. While you fellows were fishing
this afternoon, I was reading Mr. Gummere&rsquo;s
<i>Handbook of Poetics</i>. Without by any means
indorsing all that he says, I was struck by many
imaginative passages. In one place he says,
&lsquo;Something dimly personal stood behind the flash
of lightning, the roaring of the wind.&rsquo; That is
suggestive. I&rsquo;ll tell you a case in point from
my own experience in Newfoundland. Let us
call the story&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<h3>&lsquo;THE DOGS OF THE DRIFT.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The very home of visions, and strange traditions,
and mysteries, is Newfoundland, that great
half-explored island in the wild North Atlantic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here the iron coast, harborless for league upon
league, opposes a black perpendicular front to
the vast green seas, which slowly and unceasingly
beneath their veil of fogs roll in, and fall
in thunder amidst its pinnacles and caverns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At wide intervals the cliffs give way a little,
forming narrow coves and havens, so limited that
scarce a score of fishing-boats can find safe harborage
therein. In almost every such cove may be
found a tiny settlement, remote from the world,
utterly shut in upon itself save during the brief
months of summer, with no ideas but what spring
from its people&rsquo;s daily toil and from the stupendous
aspects of surrounding nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it strange that to such simple and lonely
souls the wild elements become instinct with
strange life, and seem to dominate their thoughts
and their existence?</p>
<p>&ldquo;For them the driving mists are filled with
apparitions. The gnarled and wind-beaten firs
take on strange features in the dusk. Through
the ravings of the gale against those towering
cliffs comes to their ears a hubbub of articulate
voices, mingled with the cries of the baffled sea-birds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Men dwelling under such influences are imaginative.
If left in ignorance, they grow, of necessity,
superstitious. The mouths of these islanders
overflow with unearthly tales, nearly all of which
may be traced to the workings of some natural
force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But their faith in these fancies is as unquestioning
as our acceptance of the word that the
world is round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were variously known to the islanders as
&lsquo;The Dogs of the Drift,&rsquo; &lsquo;The White Dogs,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;The Gray Dogs,&rsquo; I heard of all over the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As went the tale generally, and ever with bated
breath, these beings were a team of gigantic dogs,
lean and pale in color, driven furiously by a gaunt
woman in flowing garments of white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were said to appear to travellers caught
journeying in a storm, and to dash past with shrill
howls when the storm was at its highest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never closer did they come than within a
stone&rsquo;s throw; but their coming meant death ere
sunset to one or another of those met by the
apparition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the winter of 1888 a fire took place in the
out-harbor where I was then living, and a large
part of the winter&rsquo;s stores was destroyed. To
our secluded settlement this was an overwhelming
calamity; and there was nothing for it, if
we would escape actual starvation, but to send
some one for supplies to Harbor Briton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;The journey was one of great difficulty and
hardship,&mdash;some hundred and odd miles to be
traversed through an unbroken wilderness, and
the only means of conveyance a dog-team and a
sledge. Being young and venturesome, and ever
on the search for a new experience, I volunteered
for the service, taking with me my man,
Mike Conley, a keen hunter, and one well skilled
in driving dogs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our team was a powerful one, led by a great
black-and-white fellow, whom the other dogs devotedly
obeyed. With provision for ourselves
and team, with blankets and the other necessaries
of such a trip, our long sledge was well loaded
down; and we took with us money to buy supplies,
as well as pay the transportation of them
back to the famishing settlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We marched on snow-shoes for the most part,
save over those open stretches of plain where the
crust had hardened like ice, and where the dogs
were able, at a brisk gallop, to draw both ourselves
and their load.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At such times, exhilarated by the swift motion
in that keen air and sparkling sunshine, the
hardships of our journey were forgotten, and we
thrilled under the beauty of the glittering world
of white. But far otherwise was it when our
course lay, as it generally did, through &ldquo;juniper&rdquo;
swamps and tangled accumulation of forest-growths.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then a whole day&rsquo;s severest toil advanced us
but a few miles on our way. The dogs, floundering
in the drifts and gullies, would get their traces
into an almost hopeless snarl; and many a beating
the poor brutes brought upon themselves by the
dangerous temper they displayed under such annoyances.
They were a fierce and wolfish pack,
and a strong hand we were compelled to keep
over them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our nights, when it was fine and calm, were
pleasant enough, as we lay, wrapt in many
blankets, around our fire. Our custom was to
dig a deep hollow in the snow, and floor it with
soft boughs, leaving a space at one side for the
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a camp, nestled in a thick grove of
&ldquo;var&rdquo; or spruce, was snug in all ordinary
weather. But sometimes the rage of the gale
would make a fire impossible. The wind-gusts
would fairly shatter it to bits, and, bursting in
upon us from every quarter, drive the brands and
coals all over the camp. There was then nothing
left for us but to smother the remnants with snow,
and huddled altogether in a heap&mdash;men, dogs,
and blankets&mdash;to await wretchedly the coming
of the stormy dawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always on such occasions would Mike, who
was superstitious to the finger-tips, be looking
out in fascinated expectation for the dreadful
&lsquo;Gray Dogs.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;At each yelling blast he strained his eyes
through the dark, till from laughing at him I
grew angry, and he was constrained to hide his
fears. I represented to him that, as long as he
kept his eyes beneath his blanket, these dogs of the
drift need have no terrors for him, even should
they come the whole night long and career about
the camp; for the portent only applied to those
beholding it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This view of the case, however, was but little
relief to him, as his fears were no less on my account
than on his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notwithstanding one or two such grim experiences,
all went well with us till our journey
was two-thirds done, and the hardest of the way
lay behind us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, as we floundered one afternoon through
a deadwood swamp, Mike slipped between two
fallen trunks, and broke his left arm near the
shoulder. This was a most unlooked-for blow,
but the poor fellow bore it like a hero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With rude splints I set the arm and bandaged
it; and after a day&rsquo;s halt, I fixed him a sort
of bed on the sledge, so that we were enabled to
continue our journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now we were forced to make long detours,
in order to avoid rough country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the following morning, to our satisfaction,
we came out upon a chain of lakes which promised
us something like fair going for a while.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;In a sheltered place on the shore we found
a rude cabin occupied by two hunters, who had
their traps set in the surrounding woods. Neither
the faces nor the manner of these men did I find
prepossessing; but they received us hospitably,
fed us well, and pressed us to stay with them
over night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unnaturally, they were curious as to the
motives of our strange journey, and before I could
give him a hint of warning, my garrulous and
fearless Mike had put them in possession of the
whole story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The greedy look of intelligence which passed
furtively between them upon learning we were
on the way to purchase stores aroused all my
suspicions, and set me sharply on my guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their hospitality now became doubly pressing.
In fact, when they saw me bent on immediate
departure, they grew almost threatening in
their earnestness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this, assuming an angry air, I asked them
why they should so concern themselves about
what was entirely my own business; and I gave
them plainly to understand that I wanted no
interference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Changing their tone at once, and deprecating
my warmth, they called to my notice the storm
that was gathering overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were right; the signs could hardly be
mistaken. The little bursts and eddies of drift
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
that rose fitfully from the lake&rsquo;s white surface;
the long, whispering sob of the gusts that woke
at intervals behind the forests; the heavy but
vague massing of clouds all over the sky, which
at a little distance was confused with the earth by
a sort of pearly haze&mdash;all portended a hurricane
of snow before many hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With reason on their side, and the evident
desire of my wounded Mike as well, our hosts
urged delay till the storm should have spent its
fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But silencing Mike with a glance, I rejected
politely, but decidedly, their proffered shelter, and
made ready the team for a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as I had begun to tackle the dogs,
the younger of our hosts suddenly took up his
gun and left the cabin, saying he thought he&rsquo;d
better visit a few traps before the storm set in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He turned, I noticed, down the shore of the
lake, parallel to the direction in which our own
course lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The older man speeded our departure with all
seeming good-will, announcing that he only waited
to see us safely off, and would then follow his
partner to examine the traps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once underway I retailed my suspicions to
Mike, who, heedless as he was, had been putting
this and that together during the last few minutes.
Bitterly he bewailed his helplessness; and many
and varied were the maledictions which from his
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
couch in the blankets he hurled upon our prospective
foes. At his suggestion we shunned the
wooded shores, taking our course as nearly as possible
down the middle of the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With my rifle in one hand and my long-lashed
whip in the other, I urged the team to such
a pace as it strained my running powers to keep
up with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The snow was soft, and for the dogs, as for
myself, the work was too severe to last; but my
aim was, if possible, to settle with the first ruffian
(who had, it seemed likely, undertaken to head
us off) before the second could overtake and join
forces with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suddenly, with a whistle and a biting
blast, the storm was upon us. For a moment
the dogs cowered down in their tracks, and then
we were fain to hug the shore for shelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shelter was not much, for the storm
seemed to rage from all quarters; yet, breathless
and blinded though we were, we were able to
make some headway. At a momentary lull between
the gusts we rounded a sharp headland,
and entered a long, narrow passage between the
shore and a wooded island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A likely place enough for the murderin&rsquo;
thief!&rsquo; exclaimed Mike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we plunged ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The words had scarcely left his mouth when
the snow seemed to rise thinly about us in a thousand
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
spirals and swirls. A tremendous wind
drove down the channel and smote us in the face,
with a long, confused, yelping howl, which made
my flesh creep with its resemblance to a cry of
dogs. Our team trembled terribly and lay down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The gray dogs!&rsquo; came in a hoarse cry from
Mike&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And at the same moment there swept past us,
in the heart of the whirlwind, a pack of wild, huddling,
and leaping drifts, followed by a tall, bent,
woman-like figure of snow-cloud, which seemed
to stoop over and urge on their furious flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vision vanished, the shrill clamor died
away over the open reaches of the lake, and
shaking off my tremor, I cheered our dogs again
to the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as for Mike, he was overwhelmed with
horror. He would admit no doubt but that one
of us must die before nightfall. And for my own
part, I felt that our circumstances lent only too
ugly a color to his fancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A succession of fitful though not violent gusts
confronted us through our whole course up this
defile. The air was white with fine snow, and
we made but meagre headway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been about half a mile that we
had covered since seeing the apparition, when we
were startled by a sharp report just ahead of us;
and instantly our dogs stopped short and fell into
wild confusion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Springing to their heads, I found the great
black-and-white leader in his death-struggle, bleeding
upon the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cut the traces!&rsquo; cried Mike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And though not comprehending his purpose, I
stooped to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was well for me I obeyed. As I stooped,
a shot snapped behind us, and the shrill whimper
of a bullet sang past my ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the same moment, the gust subsiding, I
saw our first assailant step boldly out of cover
just ahead of us, and raise his gun to shoulder
for a second shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I had severed the traces; there was a sort
of fierce hiss from Mike&rsquo;s tongue, and with a yell,
the whole team sprang forward to avenge their
leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ruffian, realizing at once his peril, discharged
his gun wildly, threw it down, and fled
for his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he was too late! In briefer space, I
think, than it takes to tell it, the pack was upon
him. He was literally torn to pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With whip and gun-stock I threw myself
upon the mad brutes, who presently, as if satisfied
with their dreadful revenge, followed me back in
submission to their places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the second scoundrel, he had taken
swift warning, and vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dogs themselves seemed cowed by what
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
they had done; and for my own part, I was filled
with horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no such weak sentimentality found the
slightest favor with Mike. Rebuking me for having
beaten them, he lavished praise and endearments
upon the dogs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He reminded me, moreover, that they had
saved the lives of both of us, or had, at the very
least, saved myself from the necessity of taking
blood upon my hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Realizing this, I made hasty amends to the
poor, shivering brutes, comforting them with a
liberal feast of dried dogfish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My present feeling toward them, as I look back
upon the episode, is one of unmitigated gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest of our journey was accomplished
without more than ordinary trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good deal of my spare energy I wasted in
the effort to overturn Mike&rsquo;s faith, which stands
still unshaken in the supernatural character of the
Dogs of the Drift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With such terrible testimony in his favor I
could hardly have expected much success for my
arguments; for, as he concluded triumphantly,
&lsquo;if the spectral team came down that channel,
as it plainly did, then the scoundrel lying in wait
for us must have seen it, as well as we&mdash;and
did not he meet his doom before nightfall?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what you call a <i>merry</i> tale,&rdquo; said
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
Ranolf, &ldquo;then the one <i>I&rsquo;m</i> going to tell you of
Newfoundland will make your eyes drop &lsquo;weeping
tears.&rsquo; It concerns the fate of&mdash;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;BEN CHRISTIE&rsquo;S BULL CARIBOU.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Ben Christie was first mate of the little coasting
steamer Garnet, of the Newfoundland Coastal
Service. Born in one of those narrow &lsquo;out-harbors&rsquo;
that wedge themselves in somehow between
the cliffs and the gray sea, his eyes had been bent
seaward from the beginning. Inland all was mystery
to him&mdash;alluring mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had never been out of sight of the sea,
except when the fog was too thick for him to distinguish
it as he leaned over the vessel&rsquo;s rail. He
had grown up with a codline in his hands, in his
eyes the alternation of fog and flashing sunlight,
in his ears the scream of the seafowl, and the
shattering thunder of the surf upon the cliffs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of his native island he knew little but the
seaward faces of her rocky ramparts, over which
he had often climbed to gather the eggs of puffin
and gannet. Of towns he knew but the wharves
and water-fronts of St. John&rsquo;s and Halifax and
Harbor Grace. But he was at home in his dory
as it climbed the sullen purple-green slopes of the
great waves on &lsquo;the Banks,&rsquo; and he knew how to
follow the seal, and triumph over the perils of the
Floating Fields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day in Halifax, in a little inn on Water
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
Street, Ben Christie saw the stuffed and mounted
head of a well-antlered bull caribou. It fired his
fancy; and from that day forth to shoot a bull
caribou became his consuming ambition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he had been serving as mate of the Garnet
for about two years, the boiler of that redoubtable
craft refused to perform its functions, and she
was laid up in St. John&rsquo;s harbor for repairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christie&rsquo;s opportunity had come. He furbished
up his old muzzle-loading sealing-gun, long
of barrel and huge of bore, and took passage on a
little coasting-schooner bound for the West Shore
and the mouth of the Codroy River.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrived at the Codroy, he remained in the settlement
for a few days, looking for a suitable
comrade to go with him into the interior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When his errand became known,&mdash;which was
right speedily, seeing that he could talk of nothing
but bull caribou,&mdash;he found plenty of practised
hunters ready to accompany him on his quest;
but none of these were quite to his liking. They
all knew too much. They seemed to him to be
impressed with the idea that he did not know
anything about caribou hunting, and they talked
about &lsquo;getting him the finest pair of horns on the
barrens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now just what Ben wanted was to get those
horns himself. He wanted to do the shooting
himself, and the hunting himself; and he did <i>not</i>
want any one around to patronize him, and deride
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
his mistakes. Ben was off on a holiday, and
he felt himself entitled to make mistakes if he
wanted to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At length he met a harum-scarum little Irishman
named Mike Slohan, who said he doted on
hunting, but couldn&rsquo;t hit anything smaller than
a barn door, and wouldn&rsquo;t know&mdash;to use his own
phrase&mdash;&lsquo;a spruce caribou from a bull pa&rsquo;tridge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben took him to his heart at once, and without
delay the pair made ready for their expedition.
Inextinguishable was the mirth of all the experienced
hunters, and grievous were the mishaps they
prophesied for our amateur Nimrods till at last
Ben&rsquo;s keen blue eyes began to flash dangerously,
and they judged it prudent to check their jibes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever Mike Slohan&rsquo;s inefficiency as a hunter,
he was as fearless as a grizzly, and he understood
to its minutest detail the art of camping
out with comfort. He armed himself only with
a little muzzle-loading shotgun, but in other respects
the two went well equipped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Mike declared that all was ready, he
and Ben embarked in a canoe they had hired in
the settlement, and started gayly up the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After ascending the main stream some fifty or
sixty miles, they turned into a small tributary
which flows into the Codroy from the northward.
This stream ran between precipitous banks, often
more than a hundred feet in height. Its deep and
gloomy ravine was chiselled through a vast table-land
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
without landmark or limit, scourged by every
wind that blows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This inexpressibly bleak region Mike declared
to be &lsquo;the barrens,&rsquo; where they would find the
caribou. Into its depths they penetrated till their
way was barred by fierce rapids, at the foot of
which they made their camp in a warm and windless
cove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was well on in the autumn, a season when
the bull caribou are very pugnacious, whence it
came that Ben Christie had not long to wait before
finding himself face to face with the object
of his desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first day&rsquo;s hunting, however, was fruitless.
Leaving the camp after a by no means early
or hasty breakfast, Ben and Mike climbed the
great wall of the ravine; and no sooner were they
fairly out upon the level waste than they descried
three caribou feeding about half a mile away.
This to Ben seemed quite a matter of course;
nevertheless, he was exhilarated at the sight, and
set out in hot pursuit, followed by the laughing
Mike. They made no secret of their approach,
but advanced in plain view, as if they were driving
cattle in a pasture. And the caribou, being
in a pleasant humor and willing to avoid disturbance,
discreetly withdrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After pursuing them for three or four miles,
Ben gave up the chase, much disappointed to find
the animals so wild.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;When the hunters started to return to the
river, they were astonished to find no sign of a
river, or the course of one, anywhere in the landscape.
Mike at once concluded that they were
lost, but Ben was not troubled. He had the sun
to steer by, and was amply satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, he felt much at home on the barrens,
where, as he said, &lsquo;there was plenty of sea-room,
and a chap could breathe free.&rsquo; He shaped his
course confidently for the camp, and &lsquo;fetched&rsquo;
the river as unerringly as if it had been a port on
the South Shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The barrens, which cover so large a portion
of the interior of Newfoundland, vary somewhat
in character in different parts of the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where Ben and Mike were investigating
them, they were covered with wide patches of a
sturdy, stunted shrub called, locally, &lsquo;skronnick.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This skronnick played a most important part
in the experiences which presently befell the
hunters. It grows about shoulder-high at its
highest, and spreads out like a miniature banyan-tree.
Its twisted stems are bare to a height of
from two to three feet, and its top so densely
matted as almost to shut out the light. The
shrub is an evergreen, a remote cousin to the
juniper, and its stems are wide enough apart for
one to freely crawl about between them. When
one is caught in a storm on the barrens, the skronnick
patches make no mean shelter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;Scattered thinly amid the skronnick stood
bald, white-granite bowlders from two or three to
ten or twelve feet high; and here and there lay
deep pools,&mdash;cup-shaped hollows&mdash;filled to the
brim with transparent, icy water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Arrah,&rsquo; said Mike, as they climbed down the
ravine to the camp, &lsquo;but it&rsquo;s a quare counthry!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Ben, however, all dry land was queer. So
he hardly comprehended Mike&rsquo;s remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the following day before they set out for
the hunt a council of war was held. Said Ben,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You see, the critters won&rsquo;t let us git nigh
enough to fire at &rsquo;em afore they clear out; an&rsquo;
<i>then</i> where are we?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sure, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll hide in the skronnick,&rsquo; replied
Mike, &lsquo;an&rsquo; shoot thim as they go by.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;An&rsquo; maybe they won&rsquo;t <i>go</i> by just to oblige us,&rsquo;
suggested Ben. &lsquo;I reckon we&rsquo;ll hev to git down,
so&rsquo;s they can&rsquo;t see us, an&rsquo; crawl up on &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These tactics decided upon, the hunters
mounted to the plain, enthusiastic and sanguine.
Eagerly they scanned the bleak reaches. Not a
caribou was there in sight. Ben&rsquo;s face fell, and
he heaved a mighty sigh of disappointment. But
Mike was not so easily cast down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come on,&rsquo; said he cheerily, &lsquo;an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll find
the bastes &rsquo;fore ye know where ye are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With their guns over their shoulders, they
picked their way through the skronnick for a
couple of hundred yards, till suddenly, out from
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
behind a bowlder, not twenty paces in front of
them, stepped a huge bull caribou.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The caribou was solitary, and in a very bad
humor. He shook his spreading antlers and
snorted ominously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You shoot! He&rsquo;s yourn!&rsquo; shouted Mike in
wild excitement, brandishing his gun at full cock
over his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proudly Ben raised his long weapon to his
shoulder and pulled the trigger. There was no
marked result, however, as he had forgotten to
cock the gun. Just as he hastily remedied this
oversight, the caribou charged madly. Ben fired&mdash;and
missed!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll kill ye! Dodge him in the skronnick,&rsquo;
yelled Mike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And obediently Ben dived into the nearest
patch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Acting upon a natural instinct, he scurried
from side to side to throw his pursuer off the
track.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The caribou sprang furiously upon the bushes
where Ben had disappeared, and trampled them
with his knife-like front hoofs. Then he turned
on Mike, who had been anxiously waiting for him
to keep still and give him a fair shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In desperation Mike fired, just grazing the
animal&rsquo;s flank, and then he darted, like a rabbit,
under the skronnick bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When those deadly forehoofs came down on
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
the place where he had vanished, the little Irishman
was not there. Nimbly and noiselessly he
put all the distance he could between himself and
the spot where he heard his enemy tearing at the
skronnick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finding himself unpursued, Ben made haste
to reload his gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the sound of Mike&rsquo;s shot he thrust his head
out of his hiding-place in time to see his comrade
go under cover. Very deliberately Ben rammed
the bullet home and put on the cap. Then, standing
up to his full height, and taking aim at the
caribou&rsquo;s hind-quarters, which were towards him,
he shouted, &lsquo;Load up, Mike!&rsquo; and fired again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately for the accuracy of Ben&rsquo;s aim,
the caribou had wheeled sharp round at the sound
of his voice, and charged without an instant&rsquo;s
delay; so again the shot went wide. And again,
with alacrity that did credit to his bulk, Ben
scuttled under the skronnick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this time the indignant bull, furious at
being thus outwitted, bounded into the bush, and
began thrusting about at random with horns and
hoofs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than once Ben narrowly escaped those
terrible weapons, and his trepidation began to be
mingled with fierce wrath at the idea of being
&lsquo;hustled &rsquo;round&rsquo; this way by a &lsquo;critter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could get no chance to load up again, and
he was on the point of stepping forth and attacking
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
the animal with the butt of his gun. He felt
as if he was battened under hatches in a sinking
ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before he could put his purpose into effect,
however, there was another shot from Mike. It
evidently struck the animal somewhere, for he
bellowed with rage as he bounded over the thickets
to join battle with his other assailant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Irishman had not waited to mark the
result of his shot, but had plunged instantly out
of sight, and betaken himself to a position well
removed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The angry bull had no idea of his whereabouts,
but thrashed around wildly, while the little Irishman
chuckled in his sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as Ben once more got his gun loaded,
he stuck his head up through the skronnick. He
observed that in his wanderings beneath the scrub
he had worked his way very nearly to the big
granite bowlder before mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not fire, for he was resolved not to
waste his shot this time. Just as he made up his
mind to try a rush for the bowlder, from the top
of which he would be master of the situation, the
caribou looked up, and caught sight of him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The animal&rsquo;s charge was so lightning-like in
its rapidity that Ben could do nothing but dive
once more beneath the kindly skronnick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As fast as he could, he worked his way toward
the bowlder, but in his haste the movement of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
bushes betrayed him. One of the razor-edged
hoofs came down within a foot or two of his face,
and he shrank back swiftly, making himself very
small.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His changed course brought him to the very
brink of one of the deep pools already spoken of,
and he almost fell into it. In turning aside from
that obstacle, the shaking of the bushes again gave
the bull a hint of his position. With a cough and
a bellow the animal leaped to the spot, just missed
Ben&rsquo;s retiring feet, and plunged headlong into the
pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This seemed to Ben just his opportunity for
gaining the rock. He sprang up and made a dash
for it. But before he reached its foot,&mdash;and a
glance told him that it was not to be scaled on
that side,&mdash;the caribou had picked himself nimbly
out of the water and was after him, his fury by no
means dampened by the ducking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grinding his teeth, Ben darted yet again beneath
the scrub, but this time it was the closest
shave he had had. The skronnick was thinner here,
and he would hardly have succeeded in evading his
antagonist for more than a minute, had not Mike
come to the rescue. The Irishman rose up with
a wild yell, discharged his gun right in the caribou&rsquo;s
face, missed with his customary facility, and
dropped again into the skronnick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The foaming animal dashed away to hunt him;
and Ben, creeping stealthily around the bowlder,
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
found its accessible side, and scrambled to the
summit as the caribou came bounding to its base.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the bowlder had been a very few feet lower,
the adventure might have had a very different
issue. But as it was, the height proved sufficient.
Ben surveyed those spear-sharp prongs from his
point of vantage, just three feet beyond reach of
their vicious thrusts, and thought proudly how
fine they would look mounted in the cabin of the
Garnet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was in no great hurry to end the performance,
and he did not like to fire while the caribou
was so close to the muzzle of the gun. But presently
the animal paused and looked around for
Mike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He turned, in fact, as if to go and hunt the
little Irishman again, and Ben&rsquo;s heart smote him
for having even for a moment forgotten the peril
in which his comrade yet remained. He took
careful aim at a point close behind the caribou&rsquo;s
shoulder. At the report the animal sprang
straight into the air, and fell back stone dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very triumphant, quite pardonably so, in fact,
were Ben and Mike as they returned to the Codroy
settlement with their spoils. They discreetly
refrained from detailing at Codroy all the particulars
of the hunt. But if the tourist, exploring
the coasts of Newfoundland in the steamer Garnet,
chances to remark upon the immense pair of
caribou antlers which hang over the cabin door, he
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
will hear the whole story from Ben Christie, who
is endowed with an excellent sense of humor.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">When Ranolf ended he received unusual applause.
Then I stepped, so to speak, into the
breach. &ldquo;I cannot hope,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to win the
ears of this worshipful company with any such
gentle humor as Ranolf has just achieved. But I
have a good rousing adventure to tell you, with
lots of blood though little thunder. The scene of
it is not far from Newfoundland. Let this fact
speak in its favor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire away, Old Man!&rdquo; said Queerman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take for my narrative the simple title of&mdash;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;LABRADOR WOLVES.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In early June, two years ago, my friend, Jack
Rollings, of the Canada Geological Survey, was
occupied in exploring parts of the Labrador coast,
from the mouth of the Moisic River eastward.
The following adventure, one of several that befell
him in that wild region, has a peculiar interest
from its possible connection with a throng of terrible
legends, the scenes of which are laid along
those shores.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever since the Gulf of St. Lawrence became
known to the fishing-fleets of Brittany and the
Basque Provinces, its north-eastern coast has been
peopled, by the vivid imaginations of the fishermen
and sailors, with supernatural beings of various
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
fashions, all agreeing, however, in the attributes
of malignity and noisiness. Demons and griffins
and monsters indescribable were supposed to haunt
the bleak hills and dreadful ravines. Ships driven
reluctantly inshore by stress of weather were wont
to carry away strange tales of howlings and visions
to freeze the marrow of the folks at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The probable origin of those myths may be
found in the fact that from time to time the
coast has been ravaged by hordes of gigantic gray
wolves, sweeping down from the unfathomed wilderness
of the high interior plateau. One of these
visitations was in 1873, when many of the coast
dwellers, whose scanty settlements cling here and
there in the lonely harbors, were torn to pieces on
the shore, or shut up in their cabins till starvation
stared them in the face. No great stretch of
fancy is required to metamorphose a pack of ravening
wolves into a yelling concourse of demons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What befell Jack Rollings I will tell in his
own words.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Our schooner,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;lay at anchor in
a little landlocked bay where never a wind could
get at her, and much of our exploration was done
by means of short boat trips in one direction or
the other. One morning Frank Jones and I made
up our minds to take a day off, and try and kill a
salmon or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About five miles west of where we lay, there
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
was a cove where, behind a low, rocky point, a
little river came down out of the mountains.
Half a mile above the head of tide the stream
fell noisily over a shallow fall into a most enticing
pool, and we calculated that we would be just in
good time for the first run of the salmon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a stretch of shoals off the mouth
of the stream, and no sheltered anchorage near;
so we took the small boat for the trip, and a
fresh breeze off the gulf blew us to our destination
speedily. It was high tide when we arrived;
and we hauled up the boat in the cove, under shelter
of the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides our rods, we had enough grub for a
good lunch, and our top-coats in case it should
blow up cold in the afternoon. Frank had brought
his gun along, with a few cartridges loaded with
number one and number two shot, in case he
might want to shoot some big bird for his collection,
which is already one of the best private collections
in Ottawa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we had put our rods together, we moved
up along the wet edges of the beach, which glistened
in the morning sun, and presently found
ourselves at the basin where we expected our
sport. Over the low, foaming barrier of the falls
we saw a salmon make way in a flashing leap, and
we knew we had struck both the right place and
the right time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need not tell you the particulars of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
sport. You know what a Labrador salmon stream
is when you happen to take it in a good humor.
Enough to say, when we began to think of lunch
it was about two o&rsquo;clock; and we had six fish,
ranging from ten to thirty-five pounds, lying in
splendid array beneath a neighboring rock. As
much of our spoils as we could carry at once we
took down to the spot where the boat lay; and
building a little fire of driftwood, we proceeded to
fry some salmon collops for lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While enjoying our after-dinner smoke we
observed that the wind had shifted a point or
two to the east, and was blowing up half a gale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Great Scott!&rsquo; exclaimed Frank. &lsquo;If we don&rsquo;t
get away from here right off, we&rsquo;re going to be
storm-stayed! This wind will raise a sea presently
that we won&rsquo;t be able to face. Let&rsquo;s leave
right off! I&rsquo;ll drag the boat down to the water,
while you go after the rest of those fish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll just stay where we
are for the present. Don&rsquo;t you see that the waves
are already breaking into the cove too heavy for
us? If you were round on the other side of the
point now, you&rsquo;d see what the water is, and you&rsquo;d
be glad enough you&rsquo;re out of it, I can tell you!
We&rsquo;re all right here, and we may as well fish till
toward sundown; and if the wind has not eased
off by that time, we&rsquo;ll just have to snug the boat
up here, and foot it over the hills to the schooner.
It&rsquo;s not more than five or six miles anyway.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;Frank strolled across the point for a look at
the sea, and came back in agreement with my
views. Then we returned to the pool, and whipped
it assiduously till after five o&rsquo;clock, but without
a repetition of the morning&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile the wind got fiercer and fiercer,
so we went back to the boat and made a hearty
supper as preparation for the rough tramp that
lay before us. We took our time, and smoked at
leisure, and cached our prizes, and resolved not
to start till moonrise. By this time the tide was
well out, and the cove had become an expanse
of shingly flats, threaded by the shallow current
of the stream, and fringed along its seaward edge
with a line of angry surf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By and by the moon got up out of the gulf,
round and white, and bringing with her an extra
blow. As the shore brightened up clearly, we
set out, moving along the crest of the point.
Frank was just saying, &lsquo;How spectral those scarred
gray hills look in this light! How suitable a
place for the hobgoblins those old Frenchmen
imagined to possess them!&rsquo; when, as if to point
his remarks, there came a ghostly clamor, high
and quavering, from a dark cleft far up the
mountain-side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We both started; and I exclaimed, &lsquo;The loons
have overheard you, old fellow, and are trying to
work on your nerves! They want revenge for
the stuffed companions of their bygone days.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s not loons!&rsquo; said Frank very seriously.
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no more like loons than it&rsquo;s like lions! Listen
to that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I listened, and was convinced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then it must be those old Frenchmen&rsquo;s
friends,&rsquo; I suggested; &lsquo;and I feel greatly inclined
to avoid meeting them if possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the wolves from the interior,&rsquo; rejoined
Frank. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather have the griffins and goblins.
Don&rsquo;t you remember &rsquo;78? I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re
in a box.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let us get down to windward of the point,
and lie low among the rocks,&rsquo; I suggested. &lsquo;As
likely as not the brutes won&rsquo;t detect us, and will
keep along up the shore.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instantly we dropped into concealment, keeping,
through the apertures of the crest, a fearful
eye upon the mountain slopes. We were fools, to
be sure; for we might have known those keen
eyes had spotted us from the first, silhouetted as
we had been against the moonlit sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently Frank suggested the boat, but
my sufficient answer was to point to the raging
surf. So we lay still, and prayed to be ignored.
In a few minutes our suspense was painfully
relieved by the appearance of a pack of gray
forms, which swept out into the moonlight beyond
the river, and came heading straight for
our refuge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Two dozen of &rsquo;em!&rsquo; gasped Frank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And they&rsquo;ve certainly spotted us,&rsquo; I whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s not a tree nor a hole we can get
into!&rsquo; muttered Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We can get on top of this rock, and fight for
it,&rsquo; I groaned in desperation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have it!&rsquo; exclaimed Frank. &lsquo;The boat!
We&rsquo;ll get under it, and hold it down!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leaping to our feet we broke wildly for the
boat. The wolves greeted us with an exultant
howl as they dashed through the shallow river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had just time to do it comfortably. The
boat was heavy, and we turned it over in such a
way that the bow was steadied between two rocks.
Once safely underneath, we lifted the craft a little
and jammed her between the rocks so that the
brutes would be unable to root her over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One side was raised about eight or ten inches
by a piece of rock which Frank was going to remove;
but I stopped him. By this time the brutes
were on top of the boat, and we could hear by
the snarling that they had unearthed our salmon.
Just then a row of long snouts and snapping jaws
came under the gunwale, and we shrank as small
as possible. The brutes shoved and struggled so
mightily that it seemed as if they must succeed in
overturning the boat, and a cold sweat broke out
on my forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Shoot,&rsquo; I yelled frantically; and at the same
instant my ears were almost burst by the discharge
of both Frank&rsquo;s barrels. A terrific yelping and
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
howling ensued, while our crowded quarters were
filled to suffocation with the smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the air cleared somewhat we could see
that the wolves were eating the two whose heads
Frank&rsquo;s shot had shattered. Our position was
very cramped and uncomfortable, half-sitting, half-lying,
between the thwarts; but by stretching flat
we could peer beneath the gunwale, and command
a view of the situation. We had a moment&rsquo;s
respite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Frank,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;we might as well be eaten as
scared to death. Don&rsquo;t fire that gun again in here.
It nearly blew my ear-drums in. Club the brutes
over the snout. All that&rsquo;s necessary is to disable
them, and it seems their kind companions will do
the rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; responded Frank; &lsquo;only you must
do your share!&rsquo; and he passed me up the hatchet
out of the &lsquo;cuddy-hole&rsquo; in the bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time the slaughtered wolves were reduced
to hair and bones, and the pack once more
turned their attention to us. Once more the ominous
row of heads appeared, squeezed under the
boat-side, and claws tore madly at the roof that
sheltered us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As combatants, our positions were exceedingly
constrained; but so, too, were those of our assailants.
A wolf cannot dodge well when his head
is squeezed under a gunwale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hampered as I was I smashed the skulls of
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
the two within easiest reach, barking my knuckles
villanously as I wielded my weapon. I heard
Frank, too, pounding viciously up in the bow.
Then the attack drew off again, and the feasting
and quarrelling recommenced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I turned to make some remark to my companion,
but gave a yell of dismay instead, as I felt
a pair of iron jaws grab me by the foot, and tear
away the sole of my boot. In the excitement of
the contest my foot had gone too near the gunwale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wolves were now growing too wary to
thrust their heads under the gunwale. For a time
they merely sniffed along the edge; and though
we might easily have smashed their toes or the
ends of their noses, we refrained in order to gain
opportunity for something more effective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must have waited thus for as much as ten
minutes, and the inaction was becoming intolerable,
when the brutes, thinking perhaps we were
dead or gone to sleep, made a sudden concerted
effort to reach us. There must have been a dozen
heads at once thrust in beneath the gunwale.
One preternaturally lean wolf even wriggled his
shoulders fairly through, so that he was within
an ace of taking a mouthful out of my leg before
I could have a fair blow at him with my
hatchet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we either killed or disabled four at
least in that assault. Thereupon the pack drew
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
off a little, and sat down on their haunches to
consider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They could not possibly have been still hungry,
having eaten two or three wolves and a hundred
pounds or so of nice fresh salmon, and we were in
hopes they would go away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But instead of that they came back to the boat,
and set up a tremendous howling, which may have
been a call for re-enforcements, or a challenge
to come out and settle the trouble in a square
fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked Frank how many cartridges he had
left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;a dozen or more, at least!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Verily well,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;you&rsquo;d better blaze away
and kill as many as you can. I&rsquo;ll protect my ear-drums
by stuffing my ears full of rags. Try and
make every shot tell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the wolves were not more than eight or ten
feet away, the heavy bird-shot had the same effect
as a bullet. Two of the brutes were clean bowled
over. Then the others sprang furiously upon the
boat. When Frank thrust forth the muzzle of the
gun, it was seized and all but wrenched from his
grasp. He bagged two more; then the rest moved
round to the other side of the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But very soon the survivors appeared to make
up their minds to a new departure; and after a
little running hither and thither with their noses
down, they suddenly crystallized, as it were, into
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
a well-ordered pack, and swept away up the shore.
Their strange, terrible, wind-like ululations were
soon re-echoing in the mountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came forth from our uncomfortable but
effectual retreat, and counted our victims. When
the last sound of the howling had long died away,
we set forth in the direction of the schooner,
which was <i>not</i> the direction in which the wolves
were journeying.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">SQUATOOK RIVER AND HORTON BRANCH.</span></h2>
<p>The next was a rainy day at Camp de Squatook.
Of course we fished off and on all day,
whenever the rain held up a little; and in a deep
run, about a hundred yards below the whitefish
fence, Sam had the luck to land the big trout of
the trip. It weighed, fresh from the water, three
pounds three ounces, and it was killed with a minnow.
Sam complained, however, that it had given
him no more play than one of his two-pounders of
the day before. We thought him very artful, in
thus concealing his elation so as to ward off our
envy.</p>
<p>By nightfall it was raining pitchforks. In our
tight tent, with wax candles beaming, and the
rattle of the rain on the roof, we felt very snug.
But inexpressibly lonely was the washing sound in
the pine-branches; and all the rest of the world
seemed ages away from us. For a while no stories
were called for. Instead of that we played Mississippi
euchre. When we grew tired of the game,
Stranion exclaimed, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have one story, and
then turn in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who will hold forth?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ranolf, &ldquo;since you are all so
pressing, <i>I</i> will try and rise to the occasion. It
seems to be an understood thing that all these
stories are animal stories; but in this one I must
wander from the rule, and tell you a story of rain
and wind. The noise on the tent-roof to-night
reminds me of a nice scrape which I got myself
into only last summer. When you hear the story
you will understand just why I tell it to-night.
Sam, you heard all about it two days after it
happened. It&rsquo;s appropriate to the occasion, isn&rsquo;t
it? I mean about how I was&mdash;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;WRECKED IN A BOOM-HOUSE.&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Highly appropriate, indeed!&rdquo; said Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here you have it!&rdquo; continued Ranolf.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse me, of course, if I indulge at first
in a little technical description, to make the incidents
clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Crock&rsquo;s Point sheer-boom started from the
shore a few yards below the Point. It slanted
out and down till it met a great pier in mid-river,
to which it was secured by heavy chains. From
the pier it swung free down the middle of the
channel for a distance of several hundred yards,
swaying toward one shore or the other according
to the set of the wings and the strength of the
current. It was a sturdy structure, of squared
and bolted timbers, about three feet in width, and
rising some three or four inches above the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;The boom, of course, was jointed at the pier
so as to swing as on a hinge; and at a distance
of perhaps seventy yards below the pier it had a
second open joint. At the head of this section
stood a windlass, wound with a light wire cable.
At intervals of ten or twelve feet along the right-hand
side of this section, for about one hundred
and fifty feet in all, were hinged stout wings of
two-inch plank, ten feet long and eighteen inches
wide, set edgewise in the water so as to catch the
current, like a rudder or a centreboard. Through
iron staples, in the outer ends of these wings, ran
and was fastened the cable from the windlass.
When the cable was unwound, the wings lay flat
against the side of the boom. But a few turns
of the windlass sufficed to draw the wings out at
an angle to the boom; whereupon the force of the
current, sweeping strongly against their faces,
would slowly sway the whole free length of the
boom toward the opposite shore. The section of
the sheer-boom thus peculiarly adorned was called
the wing-boom. Just above the upper end of the
wing-boom, at a place widened out a few feet to
receive it, was built a little shanty known as the
boom-house. To the spectator from the shore the
boom-house seemed to be afloat on the wide, lonely
level of the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The office of the sheer-boom was to guide the
run of the logs as they came floating briskly down
from the lumber regions of the upper river. As
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
long as the wings were not in use, and the boom
swung with the current, the logs were allowed to
continue their journey down the middle of the
channel. But when the wings were set, and the
boom stood over toward the far shore, then
the stream of logs was diverted into the mouth
of the stationary boom, whose chain of piers held
them imprisoned till they were wanted at the mill
below the island. In the boom-house dwelt an old
lumberman named Mat Barnes, who, though his
feet and ankles were crippled with rheumatism
from exposure to the icy water in the spring
stream drivings, was, nevertheless, still clever in
the handling of boat or canoe, and very competent
to manage the windlass and the wing-boom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the southward slope of the line of uplands
which, thrusting out boldly into the river, formed
Crock&rsquo;s Point, stood a comfortable old farmhouse
in whose seclusion I was spending the months of
August and September. About four o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon, it was my daily habit to stroll down
to the shore and hail Mat Barnes, who would
presently paddle over in his skiff, and take me out
to the boom for my afternoon swim. The boom
was a most convenient and delightful place &lsquo;to go
in off of,&rsquo; as the boys say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One rough afternoon, when the boom was all
awash, and the wind sweeping up the river so
keen with suggestions of autumn that I was glad
to do my undressing and my dressing in the boom-house,
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
just as I was about to take my plunge Mat
asked if I would mind staying and watching the
boom for him while he paddled up to &ldquo;the Corners&rdquo;
to buy himself some coffee and molasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delighted,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll get back in
good time, so I won&rsquo;t keep supper waiting at the
farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back inside of an hour, sure,&rdquo; replied
Mat confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knowing Mat&rsquo;s fondness for a little gossip at
the grocery, I felt by no means so confident; but
I could not hesitate to oblige him in the matter,
a small enough return for the favors he was doing
me daily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stayed in the water nearly half an hour, and
while I was swimming about I noticed that the
wind was fast freshening. The steep and broken
waves made swimming somewhat difficult, and the
crests of the whitecaps that occasionally slapped
me in the face made me gasp for breath. While
dressing I thought, with some consternation, that
this vigorous wind would prove a serious hindrance
to Mat Barnes&rsquo;s return, as it would be blowing
directly in his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a time I sat sulkily in the door of the
boom-house, with my feet on a block to keep them
out of the wet. The door opened away from the
wind, and against the back of the little structure
the waves were beginning to lash with sufficient
violence to make me uneasy. I strained my eyes
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
up-river to catch the first glimpse of Mat forcing
his way cleverly against the tossing whitecaps.
But no such welcome vision rewarded me. At
last I was compelled to acknowledge that the
storm had become too violent for him to return
against it without assistance. I should have to
wait in the boom-house either till the wind abated,
or till Mat should succeed in finding a pair of
stout arms and a willing heart to come with him
to my rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first my thoughts dwelt with keen regret
on the smoking pancakes and luscious maple-sirup
that I knew were even then awaiting me at the
farmhouse under the hill, and somewhat bitterly I
reviled Mat&rsquo;s lack of consideration. But as the
sky grew rapidly dark while it wanted yet a half-hour
of sundown, and the wind came shrieking
more madly down from the hills, and the boom-house
began to creak and groan and shudder beneath
the waves that were leaping upon it, anxiety
for my safety took the place of all other considerations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frail as the boom-house appeared, it was well
jointed and framed, or it would simply have gone
to pieces under the various assaults of wind and
waves, and the rolling of the boom. The floor in
particular was very carefully secured, being bolted
to the boom at the four corners, that it might not
be torn away by any chance collision with log or
icecake. At every wave, however, the water came
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
spurting through the cracks of the wall, and I was
drenched almost before I knew it. Through the
open door, too, the back wash of the waves rolled
heavily; and even without the increasing peril of
the situation, the prospect of having to pass the
night in such cold, inescapable slop was far from
comforting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The door was made to fit snugly, so I shut it
in the hope of keeping out some of the water; but
in the almost total darkness that ensued my apprehensions
became unbearable. The writhing roll
of the boom grew more and more excessive, and
produced a sickening sensation. I threw the door
open again, but was greeted with such a fierce rush
of wave and spray that I shut it as quickly as I
could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had never before been on the boom-house
after dark, so I did not know what Mat was accustomed
to do for light. After much difficult groping,
however, I found a tin box, fortunately quite
waterproof, in which were matches and a good
long piece of candle. When I had succeeded in
getting the candle to burn, I stuck a fork through
it, and pinned it to the driest spot I could find,
which was the edge of Mat&rsquo;s bunk, away up close
to the roof. Presently a spurt of water struck the
veering and smoky flame, and again I was in darkness.
Of course I lost no time in relighting the
candle; but within ten minutes it was out again.
I repeated the process, and was prepared to keep
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
it up as long as the matches would hold out. In
fact, I was thankful for that little annoyance, as
it gave me something to do, and diverted my mind
somewhat from my own helplessness and from the
imminent peril of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was absolutely nothing that I could do
to help myself. To reach the shore by crawling
along the boom would have been quite impossible.
I should have inevitably been swept off before
going three feet beyond the shelter of the boom-house.
In those choppy and formless seas and
in the bewildering darkness, I should have found
it impossible to swim, or even to keep my mind
clear as to the direction in which the shore lay.
Though a strong swimmer, and accustomed to
rough water, I knew very well that in that chaos
I should soon be exhausted, and either drowned
or dashed against the boom. There was nothing
to do but wait, and pray that the boom-house
might hold together till calm or daylight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a strange picture my faint candle revealed
to me within the four narrow walls of my
refuge. All the implements and accessories of
Mat&rsquo;s somewhat primitive housekeeping had been
shaken from their shelves or from the nails on
which they hung, and were coasting about the
floor with a tinny clatter, as the boom twisted and
lurched from side to side. Three joints of rust-eaten
stovepipe kept them in countenance, and
from time to time I had to jump nimbly aside to
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
save my shins from being broken by the careering
little stove. Sometimes I would be thrown heavily
against the wall or the door. At last I climbed
into the bunk, where I crouched, dripping and shivering,
both courage and hope pretty well drenched
out of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being something of a slave to routine, when
I found myself in what resembled a sleeping-place,&mdash;or
might have resembled one under more favorable
circumstances.&mdash;I took out my watch to wind
it. The hour was half-past nine. From that hour
till nearly midnight there was no change in the
situation. Finding that the matches were running
low, I occupied myself in protecting the light
with the aid of the tin box already spoken of.
And at last, strange as it may seem, I found myself
growing sleepy. It was partly the result of
exhaustion caused by my anxiety and suspense,
but partly also, no doubt, a sort of semi-hypnotic
bewilderment induced by the motion and by the
monotonous clamor of the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I sat there crouching over the candle
I must have dropped into a doze, for suddenly I
felt myself hurled out of the bunk. I fell heavily
upon the floor. The boom-house was in utter
darkness. I staggered to my feet and groped for
the candle; it was gone from the edge of the
bunk. In my fall I had evidently swept it away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The motion of the boom had now greatly increased
in violence, and it was impossible for me
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
to stand up without clinging tightly to the edge
of the bunk. In the thick dark the stove crashed
against my legs so heavily that I thought for a
moment one of them was broken. I drew myself
up again into the bunk, no longer feeling in the
least degree sleepy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently I realized what had happened. The
boom had parted at the joint where the wings began,
and my section was swinging before the wind.
The waves frequently went clear over the roof,
and came pouring down the vacant pipe-hole in
torrents, whose volume I could guess by their
sound. The pitching, rolling, tossing, and the
thrashing of the waves were appalling; and I fervently
blessed the sound workmanship that had
put together the little boom-house so as to stand
such undreamed-of assaults. But I knew it could
not stand them much longer. Moment by moment
I expected to find myself fighting my last
battle amid a crash of mad waters and shattered
timbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a little I began to realize that the boom
must have parted in <i>two</i> places at least. From
the unchecked violence of its movements I knew
it must have broken loose at the pier. With this
knowledge came a ray of hope. As my section
was now nothing more than a long and very attenuated
raft, it might presently be blown ashore
somewhere. If the boom-house would only hold
out so long I might have a fair chance of escaping;
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
but I realized that the progress of the fragment
of boom would necessarily be slow, as wind
and current were at odds together over it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cooped up in that horrible darkness, and
clinging on to the edge of the bunk desperately
with both hands, the strain soon became so intolerable
that I began to wish the boom-house <i>would</i>
go to pieces, and put me out of my misery. None
the less, however, did my heart leap into my
throat when at length there came a massive thud,
a grinding crash, and the side of the boom-house
opposite the bunk was stove in. At the same
time the marvellously tough little structure was
twisted half off its foundations, and bent over as
if a giant hand had crushed it down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I at once concluded that we had gone ashore
on the Point. I tried to get the door open that
I might have some chance of saving myself; but
the twisting of the frame had fastened it immovably.
Madly I wrenched at it, but that very stability
of structure which had hitherto been my
safety proved now my gravest menace. I could
not budge the door; and, meanwhile, I was being
thrown into all sorts of positions, while the boom
ground heavily against the obstacle with which it
had come in contact. The boom-house was half
full of water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fierce indignation now seized me at the
thought of being drowned thus like a rat in a
hole. Reaching down into the water my hands
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
came in contact with the little stove. I raised
it aloft, and brought it down with all my strength
against the door. The stove went to pieces, bruising
and cutting my hands; but the door was shattered,
and a wave rushed in upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holding my breath, I was tearing at the remnant
of the door, in doubt as to whether I should
get free in time to escape suffocation, when the
boom gave a mightier heave, and the upper part of
the boom-house crashed against the obstacle with
a violence that tore it clear of its base. The next
instant I was in deep water, striking out blindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I came up, providentially I rose clear
of the shattered boom-house. I could see nothing,
and I was almost choked; but I kept my presence
of mind, and battled strenuously with the
boiling seas, which tossed me about like a chip.
In a second or two I was dashed against a pile
of timbers. Half-stunned, I yet made good my
hold, and instantly drew myself higher up on the
pile. As soon as I had recovered my breath sufficiently
to realize anything, I perceived that I
was on one of the piers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The upper portion of the great structure was
open, and I speedily crawled down among the
rocks with which these piers are always ballasted.
As I crouched to escape the chill wind which
hissed between the logs, how I gloried in the
thought that <i>here</i> was something not to be tossed
about by wind and wave! Drenched, shivering,
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
exhausted as I was, I nevertheless felt my bed of
rocks in the pier-top a most luxurious retreat. I
presently fell asleep, and when I awoke the dawn
was pink and amber in the eastern sky. I saw
that the pier which had given me refuge was that
to which the sheer-boom had been fastened. The
storm had moderated somewhat; and forcing its
way determinedly toward the pier came Mat&rsquo;s
skiff, propelled by Mat himself and Jim Coxen
from the Corners.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;I declare,&rdquo; said Stranion, &ldquo;I almost feel the
tent and the floor itself rocking, so vivid is the
picture Ranolf has given us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Magnus, &ldquo;it can rock us all
to sleep, and the sooner the better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a very few minutes we were snugly rolled in
our blankets. Then Stranion rose on his elbow
and blew out the candle,&mdash;&ldquo;doused the glim,&rdquo;
as he was wont to say. In the thick dark we
swiftly sank to sleep.</p>
<p>On the day after the rain, there was a wonderful
exhilaration in the air. We felt like shouting
and running races. The face of earth wore a
clean and honest look. Queerman roamed hither
and thither declaiming Miss Guiney&rsquo;s fine lines:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Up with the banners on the height,</p>
<p class="t">Set every matin-bell astir!</p>
<p class="t0">The tree-top choirs carouse in light;</p>
<p class="t">The dew&rsquo;s on phlox and lavender,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>till at last we pulled his hat down over his mouth,
and made him go fishing with us. He declared he
didn&rsquo;t want to fish that day, so we took him to
carry our captures.</p>
<p>This time we cut through the woods, and struck
the river about half a mile below the outlet. The
sparkling day had made us break bounds. At
this point the Squatook River, after rushing in
white-capped tumult down a gloomy channel,
broadens fan-like out, and breaks over a low fall
into a pool of quiet waters, out of which roars a
strong rapid. The pool is wide and deep, and girt
with great rocks. Over the black surface fleecy
masses of froth were wheeling. How our hearts
leaped at the sight! Behold us waist-deep around
the margin of the pool, or braced upon the edge of
the fall. The surface is lashed sometimes in three
or four places at once by the struggles of the
speckled prey against the slow, inexorable reel.
Our excitement is intense, but quiet. Its only expression
is the reel&rsquo;s determined click, or its thrilling,
swift rattle as the taut line cuts the water,
and the rod bends and bends. A smallish fish
has taken Sam&rsquo;s &ldquo;drop,&rdquo; and is being reeled,
half spent, across the basin. The &ldquo;leader&rdquo; trails
out behind. There is a shining swirl beside it,&mdash;a
strike; and stung by the check the very monarch
of the pool flashes up, and darts like lightning
down stream. But Sam&rsquo;s fly is sticking in his jaw.
Now, gallant fisherman, hold thine own! We forget
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
our own rods. More than once Sam&rsquo;s reel is
almost empty. For twenty minutes the result is
doubtful. Then, reluctantly, victory declares herself
for the lithe rod and the skilful wrist. The
larger of these two prizes which our lucky fisherman
thus brought to land just tipped the beam
at two and three-quarters pounds. The other was
a light half-pounder.</p>
<p>That day after a hasty lunch we bade farewell
to Camp de Squatook. The morning&rsquo;s fishing had
been so good that we resolved to keep its memory
unblurred. A sudden desire seized us for &ldquo;fresh
fields and pastures new.&rdquo; We struck tent, packed
the canoes, and paddled out joyously from the
landing. Through the whitefish barrier we slipped
smoothly and swiftly onward down the racing
current. Almost before we could realize it we
were in the wild sluice above the fall. There was
a clear channel at one side, and we raced through
the big ripples with a shout and a cheer.</p>
<p>But alas for high spirits and heedlessness!
Sam and Ranolf were in the rear canoe. They
objected to this position; and just after running
the shoot and clearing the basin, they tried to pass
Magnus and me. We were in the strong and
twisting current, however; and the first thing our
rivals knew they were thrown upon a round-backed,
weedy rock. Their canoe turned over gracefully,
and discharged her whole burden into the stream.</p>
<p>Instantly the surface of the pool was diversified
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
with floating paddles, poles, tent-pins, tin kettles,
box-covers, etc., and Stranion and Queerman, Magnus
and I, were busy capturing these estrays in the
eddy below. The canoe was got ashore, righted,
and found to be none the worse. Our heavy valuables,
guns and the like, were lashed to the canoe,
and hence got no worse than a wetting; but our
axe and various spoons and forks were gone from
our sight forever. The oatmeal was a part of our
lading, and the tobacco as well. For this last
we felt no anxiety, congratulating ourselves that it
was in a waterproof tin. We did not at the time
open this tin, as there was tobacco enough for a
time in the other canoes. But the meal-bag was
a slop. Henceforth we were to have no porridge,
only beans, beans, beans, to go with our trout and
canned knickknacks. And this meant nothing
more nor less than dinner three times a day, instead
of the old appetizing sequence of breakfast,
dinner, and&mdash;dinner.</p>
<p>After a brief delay we continued our journey.
An exciting afternoon it proved throughout, leaving
us well tired at evening. Taking care to preserve
a discreet distance between the canoes whenever
the current grew threatening, we slipped on
swiftly between ever-varying shores. Rounding
a sharp turn we would see before us a long slope
of angry water, with huddling waves and frequent
rocks; and at the foot of the slope three or
four great white &ldquo;ripples&rdquo; foaming and roaring
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
in the sun. Then a brief season of stern restraint,
strong checkings, strenuous thrustings, sudden bold
dashes, and hair&rsquo;s-breadth evasions&mdash;a plunge and
a cheer, and, drenched from the crest of that last
&ldquo;ripple,&rdquo; we would look back on the raging incline
behind us. This sort of thing took place three
times within two hours. We passed without stopping
through Second Lake, and under the majestic
front of Sugar Loaf Mountain, which is matchlessly
reflected in the deep, still waters. The
mountain towers from the water&rsquo;s edge, its base
in a cedar swamp, its lofty conical summit, which
topples towards the lake as if it had received
a mighty push from behind, veiled and softened
with thick bushes and shrubbery.</p>
<p>Some time after sundown we reached the
mouth of a tributary stream known as the Horton
Branch. This was a famous trout water, and we
determined to fish it thoroughly on the morrow.
By the time we had the tent pitched, a few trout
caught in the gathering dusk, and a mighty dinner
cooked and eaten, our eyes were filled with sleep.
We cared not for stories that night, but smoked
brief pipes and then turned in.</p>
<p>In the morning after an early breakfast we
poled up to the Big Jam, a distance of nearly six
miles. The Big Jam is a sort of dam, formed of
logs and tree-trunks and a long accumulation of
<i>d&eacute;bris</i>. Just beneath it lies one of the finest trout
pools I have ever fished&mdash;which is saying not a
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
little. The poling up Horton Branch was delightful,&mdash;a
stiffish current, but few rocks.</p>
<p>Arrived at the pool we made great haste to put
our rods together, so tempting were the eddies.
Never, surely, shall I forget that morning&rsquo;s fishing.
All the flies in our books seemed equally
killing. Those Big Jam trout were insatiable.
We soon grew hard to please, and made it a rule
to return at once to its native element every fish
that did not approach three-quarters of a pound.
This had the proper effect of limiting our take to
something near what we could at once consume.
A few fine fish we packed in salt, in a sort of basket
of birch-bark which Stranion ingeniously constructed.
Toward noon the fish stopped rising.
Then we lunched, and took a long siesta. In the
afternoon the sport was brisk, but not equal to that
of the morning. No doubt if we had stayed till
sundown the morning&rsquo;s experience would have
been amply repeated; but we were not so greedy
as to desire that. We left in high spirits at about
five o&rsquo;clock, and slipped merrily down to our camp
on the main Squatook.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">THE CAMP ON SQUATOOK RIVER.</span></h2>
<p>That night around the camp-fire stories were
once more in demand. Stranion was first called
upon, and he at once responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call this story&mdash;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;SAVED BY A SLIVER,&rsquo;</h3>
<p>and ask you to observe the neat alliteration,&rdquo; said
Stranion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the autumn of 1887 I was hunting in those
wildernesses about the headwaters of that famous
salmon river, the south-west Miramichi. I had old
Jake Christison with me, the best woodsman on
the river; and I had also my inseparable companion
and most faithful follower, Jeff, a large bull-terrier.
Jeff was not a hunting-dog in any accepted
sense of the word. He had no inherited instinct
for the chase; but he had remarkable intelligence,
unconquerable pluck, unquestioning obedience,
and hence a certain fitness for any emergency that
might arise. In the woods he always crept noiselessly
at my heels, as unembarrassing and self-effacing
as my shadow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;One morning we set out from camp soon after
breakfast to follow up some fresh caribou signs
which Jake had just reported. We had gone
but half a mile into the thickets when the woodsman
discovered that he had left his hunting-knife
by the camp-fire, where he had been using it to
slice the breakfast bacon. To go without his
hunting-knife could not for a moment be thought
of; so he turned back hurriedly to get it, while
I strolled on at a leisurely pace with Jeff at my
heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My way led me through a little wide ravine,
in the centre of which lay the fragments of a
giant pine, shattered years ago by lightning, and
bleached by storm and sun. A portion of the
trunk remained yet upright,&mdash;a tall splinter, or
&lsquo;sliver&rsquo; as the woodsmen call it, split from the rest
of the trunk by some electric freak, and pointing
like a stern white finger toward the spot of open
sky above, whence the bolt had fallen. Saturated
with resins, the sliver was practically incorruptible;
and time had only served to harden its lance-like
point and edge. A few feet beyond this blasted
pine the woods grew thick,&mdash;a dusky confusion
of great gnarled trunks and twisting limbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I sauntered up to the foot of that whitened
trunk, Jeff suddenly thrust himself in front of me
with a low, almost inaudible growl, and stood obstinately
still, as if to bar my farther advance.
Instantly my glance penetrated the thicket, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
fell upon a huge panther crouching flat along a
fallen tree of almost the same color as the brute&rsquo;s
hide. It was the panther&rsquo;s cold green eyes indeed
that so promptly revealed him to me. He was in
the attitude to spring; and ordering Jeff &lsquo;to heel,&rsquo;
I sank on one knee, cocking my rifle and taking
aim at the same time, for there was not a moment
to lose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even as I pulled the trigger the animal
dashed upon me, in the very face of the flash.
The suddenness of the assault of course upset
my aim; but by good chance the ball went
through the animal&rsquo;s fore shoulder, breaking the
bone. I was hurled backward into a hollow under
the fallen fragments of the pine-tree, and I
felt the panther&rsquo;s teeth go through my left arm.
Thrusting myself as far as possible beneath the
shelter of the log, I reached for the long knife
at my belt. Just as I got it out of its sheath,
the panther, with an angry cry, dropped my arm,
and turned half round, while keeping his place
upon my prostrate body. My faithful Jeff had
come to the rescue of his master, and had sunk
his terrible teeth into the root of the panther&rsquo;s
tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The snarling beast doubled back upon himself,
and struggled to seize the dog between his
jaws; but Jeff was too wary and active for this,
and the panther would not leave his post of vantage
on my body. He was a sagacious beast, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
perceived that if he should let me up he would
have two enemies to contend with instead of one.
As for me, in my restricted position, I found myself
unable to use my knife with any effect. I lay
still, abiding my opportunity, and watching with
intense but curiously impersonal interest the good
fight my bull-terrier was making. I was not conscious
of much pain in my arm, but the shock of
the panther&rsquo;s assault seemed in some way to have
weakened my vital force. Presently the panther,
finding it impossible to release himself from that
deadly grip of Jeff&rsquo;s, threw himself over on his
back, curling himself up like a cat, and raked the
dog severely with his dangerous hind claws. The
change in our assailant&rsquo;s position released my right
arm, and at once I drove the knife into his side
square to the hilt. I failed to touch a vital spot,
but the wound diverted his attention; and Jeff,
bleeding and furious, was enabled to secure a new
hold. The panther was a splendid beast, and
fought as I never before or since have seen a panther
fight. Had it not been for my shot, which
broke his fore shoulder, it would have gone hard
with both Jeff and me. As it was, however, the
panther found his work cut out for him, though I
was so nearly helpless from my position that Jeff
had to bear the brunt of the battle. The brave
terrier was getting badly cut up. I could not see
very well what went on, being at the bottom of
the fight, and my breath nearly knocked out of
me; but all of a sudden a rifle-shot rang in my
ears, the smoke and flame filled my eyes, and the
body of the panther stiffened out convulsively.
The next moment old Jake was dragging me out
from beneath, and anxiously inquiring about my
damages.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;Reassuring him as to my condition, I sat down
rather faintly on the trunk, while Jeff, at my
feet, lay licking his scratches. The old woodsman
leaned upon his empty rifle, contemplatively scanning
our vanquished foe, and loudly praising Jeff.
Suddenly he broke off in the midst of a sentence,
and glanced up into the branches ahead of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Great Jee-hoshaphat!&rsquo; he exclaimed in a
startled voice, springing backward, and snatching
for a fresh cartridge, while Jeff jumped to his feet
with a wrathful snarl. In the same breath, before
I could realize what was the matter, I heard the
female panther, mate of him we had killed, utter
her fearful scream of rage and pain. From a
giant limb overhead her long tawny body flashed
out into the sunlight, descending upon our devoted
party like a yellow thunderbolt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weak and dazed as I was, I shut my eyes
with a sense of sick disgust and weariness, and a
strange feeling of infinite suspense. There was
a curious sound of tearing and scratching; but
no shock came, and I opened my eyes in astonishment.
There was Jake calmly slipping a cartridge
into his rifle. There was Jeff standing just
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
as I had seen him when I closed my eyes. It
seemed hours, but it had been merely an eyewink&mdash;the
fraction of a second. But where was the
panther?</p>
<p>&ldquo;My inward query was answered on the instant.
A wild and indescribable screeching, spitting,
and snarling arose, mixed with a sound of claws
tearing desperately at the hard wood of the pine
trunk. The panther was held aloft in the air,
impaled on the sliver, around which she spun
madly like a frightful wheel of tawny fire. Her
efforts to free herself were tremendous, but there
was no escape. The sliver was hard as steel and
as inexorable. Suddenly Jeff sprang at the creature,
but in his impetuosity missed his hold, and
got a lightning blow from one of those great
claws, almost laying his side open. The brave
dog carries the marks of that wound to this day.
His revenge was instantaneous; for his next leap
gained its object, and his jaws fixed themselves
securely in the panther&rsquo;s haunches. The whole
wild scene had thus far been like a dream to me,
and the yellings and snarlings sounded far off and
indistinct. The only reality seemed to me the
still brown and green of the forest, the moveless
tree-tops, the cheerful morning sun streaming
down into the little glade, and the old woodsman
standing in his contemplative attitude, watching
the gyrating form of the panther. Then on a
sudden my blood seemed to flow with a rush of
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
new force, and a sense of reality came back to me.
I jumped up, slipped a cartridge into my rifle, and
with a timely bullet put the unhappy beast out
of its pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In order to release the panther&rsquo;s body we had
to cut down the sliver, the blood-stained top of
which, with its point sharp and spear-like, as if
fashioned by the hand of man, now hangs as a
treasured relic upon my library wall. Right beneath,
as a foot-rug to my writing-table, and a
favorite napping-place for Jeff, is the panther-skin
with two holes in it, where the sliver went
through. The other skin I gave to old Jake as a
memorial of the adventure; but it is probable he
sold it at the earliest fair opportunity, for it was
a comely and valuable skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Stranion,&rdquo; said I when he concluded, &ldquo;your
Jeff is one of the dogs whom I am proud to have
known. I have only met, in all my career, one
better dog, and that was my brave old Dan, of
blessed and many-scarred memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bigger, not better, dog,&rdquo; interrupted Stranion
sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we won&rsquo;t argue over it. They were
both of the same stock, anyway; and I fear we
will not look upon their like again, eh, Stranion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you are talking, O. M.,&rdquo; responded
Stranion warmly. &ldquo;But tell us that great yarn
about Dan&rsquo;s battle!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, not to-night,&rdquo; was my answer. &ldquo;It
would seem like making rivals of Dan and Jeff,
which they never were, but always sworn chums.
Jeff is enough for one night. Dan shall be commemorated
on another. Let Sam give us a bear
story now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s one in which
Stranion and I were both concerned. Note it
down by the name of&mdash;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;SKIDDED LANDING.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Three winters ago, as some of you will remember,
Stranion and I took a month in the
lumber-woods. It was drawing on toward spring.
As we were both good snow-shoers, we managed
to visit several widely scattered camps. At all
we were received hospitably, with unlimited pork
and beans, hot bread and tea; and at each we
made a stay of several days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For our climax we selected that camp which
promised us the most picturesque and exciting
experiences at the breaking up of the ice. This
was Evans&rsquo;s Camp on Green River, where the logs
were gathered in what is known as a &lsquo;rough-and-tumble
landing,&rsquo;&mdash;a form which entails much
excitement and often grave peril to the axeman
whose work is to cut the &lsquo;brow&rsquo; loose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it happened, however, the most stirring
adventure that fell to our personal experience
on that trip was one we encountered at Clarke&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
Camp, on the Tobique, where we stayed but three
days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This camp, but one of the many centres of
operation of the great lumbering firm of Clarke
&amp; Co., was generally known as &lsquo;Skidded Landing.&rsquo;
And here let me explain the terms &lsquo;brow,&rsquo;
&lsquo;drive,&rsquo; &lsquo;rough-and-tumble landing,&rsquo; and &lsquo;skidded
landing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In lumbermen&rsquo;s parlance, the logs of the winter&rsquo;s
chopping, hauled and piled on the river-bank
where they can conveniently be launched
into the water upon the breaking up of the ice,
are termed collectively &lsquo;a brow of logs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When once the logs have been got into the
water, and, shepherded by the lumbermen with
their pike-poles, are flocking wildly seaward on
the swollen current, they and their guardians
together constitute &lsquo;the drive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The task the lumbermen are now engaged upon
is termed &lsquo;stream driving;&rsquo; and laborious, perilous
work it is, especially on those rivers which are
much obstructed by rapids, rocks, and shoals. A
brow of logs is a &lsquo;landing&rsquo; when the logs are
piled from the water&rsquo;s edge. A landing may be
either a &lsquo;rough-and-tumble&rsquo; or a &lsquo;skidded&rsquo; landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;rough-and-tumble,&rsquo; which good woodsmen
generally regard as a shiftless affair, is made
by driving a few heavy timbers into the mud at
the water&rsquo;s edge, at the foot of a sloping bank.
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
These form a strong and lofty breastwork. Into
the space behind are tumbled the logs helter-skelter
from the top of the bank, as they are
hauled from the woods. All through the winter
the space keeps filling up, and by spring the
strain on the sustaining piles is something tremendous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the thaw comes and the river rises, and
the ice goes out with a rush, then the accumulation
of logs has to be set free. This is done by
cutting away the most important of the sustaining
timbers, whereupon the others snap, and the
logs go roaring out in a terrific avalanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is easy to realize the perils of cutting out
this kind of landing. If the landing has been
unskilfully or carelessly located, the peril of the
enterprise is greatly increased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;skidded&rsquo; landing is a much more business-like
affair. In this kind of structure the logs
are placed systematically. First a layer of logs
is deposited parallel with the river&rsquo;s edge. Across
these, at right angles, are laid a few light poles,
technically termed <i>skids</i>. On these another layer
of logs parallel to the water, and so on to the
completion of the structure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this species of landing, to release the
logs is a very simple matter. There is nothing
to do but quietly roll them off, layer by layer,
into the stream, which snatches them and hurries
them away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;From this it will be seen why we did not
elect to stay long at Skidded Landing. But
while we were there something happened in this
fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the second day of our stay in the camp,
it chanced that Stranion was lazy. When I set
forth to examine some snares which I had set the
night before, he chose to snooze in his bunk rather
than accompany me. As events befell, he proved
to have made the wiser choice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I took my gun with me. I was
thinking of small game exclusively,&mdash;during our
wanderings, hitherto, we had seen nothing larger
than a fox,&mdash;and both barrels were loaded with
cartridges containing No. 4 shot. But with unaccountable
thoughtlessness I neglected to take
any heavier ammunition in my pocket; yet that
was the only time on the trip that heavier ammunition
was needed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I visited my snares, and found in one of them
a rabbit. &lsquo;The boys&rsquo;ll appreciate a rabbit stew,&rsquo;
thought I, as I hitched the frozen carcass to my
belt. A little farther on I started another rabbit,
which I shot, and hitched beside its fellow; and
then I struck out blithely for camp. Before I
had retraced my path many paces, I came face
to face with an immense bear, which apparently
had been dogging my steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We halted and eyed each other sharply. I
thought I detected a guilty uneasiness in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
animal&rsquo;s gaze, as if he were properly ashamed of
himself for his ungentlemanly conduct. Presuming
upon this, I spoke in an authoritative voice,
and took one or two firm steps in advance. I
expected the animal to step aside deferentially
and let me pass, but I had forgotten that this
was a hungry season for bears. The brute lumbered
forward with alacrity, as if ferociously
surprised at my readiness to furnish him a
much-needed luncheon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my trepidation I did not let him get near
enough before I fired my solitary cartridge. Had
I let him come to close quarters, the heavy bird-shot
would have served the full purpose of a
bullet. But no, I was in too much of a hurry.
The charge had room to scatter before it reached
my assailant; and the pellets only served to cut
him up badly about the head without in the least
interfering with his fighting capacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With something between a grunt and a howl
of pain and fury he dashed upon me; and I, dropping
my cherished weapon in a panic, made a
mighty bound to one side and darted toward the
open river. I wanted free play for my snow-shoes,
and no risk from hidden stumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the woods the snow was soft enough to
give me some advantage over my pursuer. I
gained on him when doing my utmost. But being
gaunt from his long fast, and very light in
proportion to his prodigious strength, his progress,
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
with that awkward gallop of his, was terrifyingly
rapid. Moreover, I had vividly before my mind&rsquo;s
eye the consciousness of what would be my instant
fate should I trip on a buried stump or root,
or plunge into some snow-veiled bush that would
entangle my snow-shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once out upon the river I breathed more
freely. But the bear was hard upon my heels.
Here the snow was more firmly packed, and he
travelled faster. I ceased to increase the little
distance between us. After two piercing yells for
help, I saved my breath for the race before me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was really not very far from the camp; but
the trees and a high point intercepted my cries,
and the wind blew them away, so they failed to
reach Stranion&rsquo;s ears. Nevertheless, it happened
that Stranion grew restless about the time of my
first meeting with the bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He strolled down to the landing, which was
perhaps three hundred yards from the camp,
seated himself upon a spruce log, and began to
dig off with his pocket-knife the perfumed amber-like
globules of gum. He was engaged in this
innocent if not engrossing occupation when he
caught sight of me racing desperately around the
jutting point immediately above the landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the sight of my terror he sprang to his
feet, and was about to rush back to camp for his
gun; but straightway the bear appeared, and so
close behind me that he knew there was no time
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
to get the weapon. The emergency was upon
him. He knew something had to be done at
once. Fortunately he was ready of resource.
He dropped down, and crawled swiftly to the
edge of the landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The track I was following led along close
under the front of the landing, then turned the
corner sharply and ran straight up to the camp.
The bear was now gaining on me. He was not
more than thirty or forty feet behind. I was beginning
to realize that he must catch me before
I could reach the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming to this conclusion, I was just about
to put forth all my remaining breath in one despairing
shriek for help, then to turn and make
what fight I could with my sheath-knife, which
had already been used to cut away the dangling
rabbits, when out of the corner of my eye I caught
sight of Stranion on the top of the logs. I took
one look at his face and saw its look of readiness.
He grinned encouragingly, but put his finger on
his lips for silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the sight of him I felt new vigor flow
through all my veins. With fresh speed I raced
along past the front of the landing, turned the
corner, and bounded up the slope. Reaching the
hard track, I kicked my feet clear of the snow-shoes,
and started to climb up the logs to join
Stranion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this moment Stranion found his opportunity.
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
The bear came plunging along on my tracks,
immediately beneath the face of the logs. And
now, with a stake which he had snatched up,
Stranion pried mightily upon the two front logs
of the top tier. The great timbers rolled swiftly
over the edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of them, the heaviest, was just in time.
It caught the animal over the hindquarters, and
crushed him to the ice. When Stranion&rsquo;s triumphant
shout proclaimed the success of his attack,
I threw myself down between two logs and lay
there gasping, while Stranion returned to the
camp, got his gun, and put the wounded animal
out of his pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later in the day, much later, Stranion and
I together went over the ground I had traversed
with such celerity. We recovered the rabbits,
and also, after a persistent search in the snow,
the gun which I had so basely abandoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;I think that is a pretty straight account of
what happened,&rdquo; said Stranion; &ldquo;and now we
will hear something from Magnus&rsquo;s uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Magnus; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something
my cousin Bob Raven told me about a time he
had with&mdash;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;A MAD STALLION.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;There is perhaps no beast,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;more
terrible, more awe-inspiring, than a stallion that
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
has gone mad. Such an animal, bursting all the
fetters of his inherited dread of man, seems inspired
with a frightful craving to take vengeance
for the immemorial servitude of his kind. As a
rule, he has no quarrel with anything but humanity.
Often with other horses he associates
amicably, and toward the cattle and lesser animals
that may be with him in the fields he displays the
indifference of disdain. But let man, woman, or
child come within his vision, and his homicidal
mania breaks into flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had several disagreeable encounters with
vicious horses, but only once was I so unfortunate
as to fall in with one possessed by this homicidal
mania. My escape was so narrow, and the experience
left so deep an impression upon my mind,
that I have felt ever since an instinctive distrust
for this most noble of domestic animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One autumn, when I was about eighteen, I
was taking a tramp through the eastern townships
of Quebec preparatory to resuming work at college.
I reached the little village of Maybury one
day at noon, and dropped into the village inn for
luncheon. The village was in a state of excitement
over a tragedy which had taken place that
very morning, and which was speedily detailed
to me by every one with whom I came in contact.
The most authentic account, as it appeared, was
that given me by the proprietor of the inn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You see,&rsquo; he answered eagerly, in response
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
to my question as to the cause of the general excitement,
&lsquo;a boy &rsquo;at old Joe Cook was bringin&rsquo; up
on his farm has jest been killed by a mad horse.
The boy come out from Liverpool las&rsquo; June two
year ago, with a lot more poor little beggars like
him; an&rsquo; old Joe kinder took a fancy to him, an&rsquo;
was a-bringin&rsquo; him up like he was his own son.
The horses is mostly runnin&rsquo; at pasture now in
the back lots yonder; an&rsquo; Atkinson&rsquo;s stallion, what
has always had the name of bein&rsquo; kind as a lamb,
is pasturin&rsquo; with the rest. But he seems somehow
to&rsquo;ve gone mad all on a suddent. This mornin&rsquo;
airly, as Cook&rsquo;s boy was comin&rsquo; home from drivin&rsquo;
the cows out onter the uplands, he found the
horses all crowdin&rsquo; roun&rsquo; the gate leadin&rsquo; onter the
meadows. He knowed some of &rsquo;em might try and
shove through if he didn&rsquo;t take keer, so he jest
kind of shooed &rsquo;em off with a stick. They all
scattered away savin&rsquo; only Atkinson&rsquo;s stallion; an&rsquo;
he, wheelin&rsquo; round with a kind of screech as&rsquo;d
make the marrer freeze in your bones, grabbed the
boy right by the back of the neck, an&rsquo; shook him
like old Tige there&rsquo;d shake a rat. I guess the
poor boy&rsquo;s neck was broke right off, for he never
cried out nor nothin&rsquo;. Steve Barnes was jest then
a-comin&rsquo; up the meadow road, an&rsquo; he seen it all.
He yelled, an&rsquo; run up as fast as he could; but
afore he could git to the fence the stallion had
jumped on the boy two or three times, an&rsquo; was
a-standin&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; at him curious-like. Steve seen
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
&rsquo;at the boy was dead, but he started to climb over
an&rsquo; drive off the brute; but as soon as the stallion
seen Steve he let another screech, an&rsquo; run at him
with his mouth wide open, an&rsquo; Steve had nothin&rsquo;
fur it but to hop back quick over the fence.
Seein&rsquo; as the boy was deader&rsquo;n a door-nail, Steve
didn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d be common-sense to resk his life
jest for the dead body; but he stayed there a-stonin&rsquo;
the brute, which was jest spilin&rsquo; to git at him.
After &rsquo;bout an hour the other horses came back,
an&rsquo; the stallion forgot about the boy an&rsquo; went
off with them &rsquo;way back behind the hills; an&rsquo;
Steve got the body an&rsquo; carried it home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what have they done to the brute?&rsquo;
I inquired, with a fierce anger stirring in my
veins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; answered Boniface, &lsquo;this afternoon
there&rsquo;s a crowd goin&rsquo; out to ketch him an&rsquo; tie
him up. If he&rsquo;s too bad fur that,&mdash;an&rsquo; if I know
anything about horses he&rsquo;s jest gone mad, stark
mad,&mdash;why, they&rsquo;ll have to shoot him off-hand,
to save their own necks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wonder if I&rsquo;ll run any risk of meeting
him?&rsquo; I queried rather anxiously. I had no weapon
but my heavy walking-stick, and I had an
almost sentimental regard for the integrity of my
neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Which way be you bound?&rsquo; inquired Boniface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;For Blissville,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re all right then. The
horses are feedin&rsquo; out yonder to the no&rsquo;th-east,
an&rsquo; Blissville lays south.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was with few misgivings that I now resumed
my journey. In the tonic autumn air my spirits
rose exultantly, and I walked with a brisk step,
whistling and knocking off the golden tops of the
hawk-bit with my cane. The country about Maybury
is a high, rolling plateau, for the most part
open pasture-ground, with here and there a shallow,
wooded ravine, and here and there a terrace
of loose bowlders with bramble-thickets growing
between. I was soon beyond the cultivated fields,
past the last of the fences. I had climbed one of
those rocky terraces, and made a couple of hundred
yards across the delightful breezy down,
when, behind a low knoll, I caught sight of a
group of horses quietly pasturing, and remembered
with a qualm the morning&rsquo;s tragedy. Could
this, I asked myself anxiously, be the herd containing
that mad stallion?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I halted, and was about to retrace my steps
unobtrusively, in the hope that I had escaped their
notice. But it was too late. Two or three of
the animals raised their heads and looked toward
me. One in the group snorted with a peculiar
half-whinny, at the sound of which my heart
sank. Then I caught sight of one in the centre
that seemed to be jumping up in the air off all
four feet at once. The next moment this creature,
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
a great black animal, appeared outside the group,
plunging and biting at his flank. Two or three
times he sprang into the air in that strange, spasmodic
way I had already observed, and threw his
head backward over his right shoulder with an indescribable
gesture of menace and defiance. Then
with a short, dreadful sound he darted toward me,
open-mouthed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up to this point I had stood my ground, eying
the brute resolutely, with an appearance of fearlessness
which I was very far from feeling. But
now I saw that my only hope, and that a desperate
one, lay in flight. I was accounted at college a
first-rate sprinter, and now I ran my best. The
two hundred yards that lay between me and the
terrace I had just left must have been covered in
not much more than twenty seconds. But as I
reached the brow of the slope the mad brute was
close on my heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no time to check myself, and even less
notion to do so. In fact, I fell, and rolled headlong
down, dropping bruised and bewildered into
a crevice between two bowlders. The next instant
I saw the black mass of my pursuer dashing
over me in a splendid leap. Before he could turn
and seize me I had rolled farther into the crevice,
and found that one of the rocks overhung so as
to form a little narrow cave into which I could
squeeze myself so far as to be quite beyond the
animal&rsquo;s reach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never before or since have I discovered so unexpected
and providential a refuge. The raving
stallion came bounding and leaping up to the very
door of my burrow, but I felt safe. He would
roll back his lips, lay his ears flat to his head,
spring straight into the air, and shriek through
his wide, red nostrils his fury and his challenge.
The latter I did not think it incumbent upon me
to accept. I waived it in disdainful silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a time the brute kept up his boundings
and those strange, proud jerkings of his head; but
at length he actually tried to stretch his neck into
my burrow, and reach me with his frightful naked
teeth. This was a vain attempt; but I resented
it, and picking up a stone which lay at hand, I
struck him a heavy blow on the nose. This
brought the blood from those cruel nostrils, and
made him even, if possible, more furious in his
rage; but he returned to his former demonstrations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been for nearly an hour that I
watched the mad creature&rsquo;s antics from my den.
The rest of the herd had approached, and were
feeding indifferently about the foot of the terrace.
From time to time my enemy would join them,
and snatch a few restless mouthfuls of grass. But
almost immediately he would return to his post at
my door, and his vigilant watch was on me all the
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was beginning to cast about somewhat anxiously
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
for a way of escape from this imprisonment,
when I saw the pasturing herd suddenly toss up
their heads, and then go scurrying away across the
down. My adversary saw this, too, and turned
his attention away from me. I peered forth cautiously,
and to my profound relief I observed a
party of men, several carrying ropes and halters,
and others armed with rifles, approaching below
the terrace. One man walked a little ahead of
the others, and held out a peck measure, in which
he shook something which I presume to have
been oats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stallion eyed them sombrely for an instant;
and then his mane rose like a crest, and his
head went back with a shrill cry. In the self-same
way as he had greeted my appearance he
bounced into the air twice or thrice, and then he
dashed upon the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man with the oats fell back with wonderful
alacrity, and the fellows who carried halters
seemed bent upon effacing themselves in the
humblest manner possible. One tall, gray-shirted
woodsman, however, stepped to the front, raised his
rifle, and drew a bead upon the approaching fury,
while two or three of the others held their shots in
reserve. There was a moment of breathless suspense.
Then the fine, thin note of the woodsman&rsquo;s
rifle rang out; and the stallion sprang aside with
a shriek, and stumbled forward upon his knees.
Almost instantly, however, he recovered himself,
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
and rushed upon his opponents with undiminished
ferocity. I held my breath. He was almost upon
the party now. Then two more rifles flashed from
the marksmen standing moveless in their tracks,
and the mad brute rose straight up on his hind
legs, and fell over backward, dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stepped out to welcome my rescuers, and
detailed to them my adventures. They had been
wondering who or what it was that the brute was
laying siege to. There was so much, in fact, to
talk about, and I found myself for the moment so
important a figure, that I returned to Maybury for
that evening, and there had to retell my story at
least a score of times.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s my turn now&mdash;and I suppose it is,&rdquo;
said Ranolf, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t pretend to give you anything
so blood-curdling as this story of Magnus&rsquo;s; but
I&rsquo;ll do my little best to make an angry bull moose
as interesting as a mad stallion. Take this down,
O. M., as&mdash;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;AN ADVENTURE WITH A BULL MOOSE.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about the lumber-camps;
but I got this from a Restigouche lumberman, so of
course it must be true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day a woodsman, who had been on a long
tramp prospecting for prime birch timber, rushed
into a camp on the Restigouche with news that
he had discovered a &lsquo;yard&rsquo; of moose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;A &lsquo;yard&rsquo; it may here be explained, is an
opening in the forest where a herd of moose has
trampled down the snow and made its headquarters.
The yard is always surrounded by
young trees, upon whose succulent shoots the
moose feed. It forms a striking scene&mdash;the animals
lying about the space of trampled and discolored
snow, while here and there a magnificently
antlered bull towers above the rest, keeping watch;
and here and there on the edge of the yard an
animal is reaching aloft its long, prehensile lips
to tear down its meal of green branches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, the news which the inspector brought
into camp created an instant interest. Fresh meat
was at a premium in the Restigouche Camp; and
at the thought of moose-meat, which is a sort of
beef idealized, every lumberman&rsquo;s mouth began to
water longingly. The boss was quite at one with
the hands in this respect; wherefore it was not
long before a hunt was organized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only those men could take part who had snowshoes,
for the snow was deep that season. So there
was a small muster of five; but with those five
went the blessings of the camp. Upon their success
hung the hopes of all their hungry comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wind, fortunately for the hunters, was
blowing from the yard to the camp, so that it was
not necessary to take a roundabout course. The
expedition was led by the prospector, who was an
enthusiastic hunter, and skilled in woodcraft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was past midday as the yard was approached.
The hunters separated, and closed in
on the yard from all sides save that from which
the wind was directly blowing. The leader,
whose name was Story, had the longest way to
go, in order that by the time he could get into
position all the others might be ready and
waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently an owl was heard to hoot twice.
This was Story&rsquo;s signal. The moose heard it too,
and pricked up their ears; for the owls they were
accustomed to hear hooted, as a rule, in the night-time.
Then they heard the soft, hurried tramping
of the snow-shoes, and the crackling of frosted
twigs all about them, and huddled together, terrified,
in the middle of their yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next moment five rifles blazed out upon
them, and the hunters rushed in. Two of the
creatures fell at the volley, and two more, fat
young cows, were knifed by the nimble huntsmen;
and the rest of the herd dashed wildly off, running
up the wind, where they scented no danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Story was in a great disgust. His shot
had failed to kill. He had fired at the chief of
the herd, a splendid bull, whose antlers he craved
as a trophy. The bull was struck somewhere in
the body, for he staggered; but instantly recovering,
he had charged fiercely in the direction of the
assault. Story had stepped behind a tree; and the
mad beast, not detecting him, had continued his
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
career through the woods, almost at right angles
to the direction which was taken by the rest of
the herd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Story gave chase at a run, loading as he went.
The bull was already out of sight, but his track
was ample guide. The hunter knew he had hit
the animal hard, and looked for a speedy triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For an hour he continued his long trot, encouraged
from time to time by the sight of blood
upon the snow. The animal&rsquo;s path led at last
through a region of gullies and copses, and low,
broad beech-trees. Suddenly, as Story was skirting
the crest of a little ravine, from a thicket close
ahead of him the great moose dashed out with a
bellow, and charged upon him like lightning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hunter had not time to check himself, but
whipped the gun to his shoulder and took a snap-shot.
Even at the same instant the snow gave
way beneath his feet, and his shot flew wide as
he rolled to the foot of the ravine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The animal was upon him before he could recover
himself, and he thought his end was come.
Dropping his gun, now useless, he drew his knife,
and, just escaping one keen prong, he seized the
antlers with one hand, while with the other he
slashed at the animal&rsquo;s neck. It was the depth
and softness of the snow, with the confusion of
bushes and roots beneath it, that saved him from
being crushed at once.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/img008.jpg" alt="" width="567" height="800" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;<span class="sc">At last He looked Upward, and saw the Hunter.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Page 221.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>&ldquo;As the moose felt the knife in his neck he
drew back, and threw up his head with violence,
intending to trample his adversary with his terrible
hoofs; but the neck of the moose has tremendous
power, and as the hunter clung to his hold
with desperate tenacity, knowing that his last
chance depended on it, he was thrown high into
the air. He came in contact violently with a
beech-tree branch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thinks quickly in such emergencies as
these; or rather an instinct, drowsy at other times,
wakes up and saves us the need of thought.
Story flung both arms around the branch, and
with a great sigh of thankfulness, and possibly an
inward utterance of the same, swung himself out
of harm&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When his opponent failed to fall, the moose
was astonished. He turned round and round, and
tore up the snow, and bellowed hoarsely in his
rage. The thing was inexplicable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last he looked upward, and saw the hunter
in the branches. His indignation waxed fiercer
than ever, and he made desperate efforts to pull
down the branches by seizing and breaking off
their tips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How the huntsman chuckled and derided him!</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a time the mad brute grew more calm.
Then, to Story&rsquo;s supreme disgust, he lay down
under the tree to starve his prisoner out. The
hunter had no gun. The weather was severe.
There was nothing to eat. There was no way
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
of stealing off unobserved. To crown all, the
wretched man recalled a number of incidents
showing the implacable persistence of the wounded
bulls of this species.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For perhaps an hour the hunter waited, vainly
hoping that this particular moose would prove less
obstinate than his kind, or would get homesick for
the rest of the herd, or would die of his inward
wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But nothing seemed farther from the animal&rsquo;s
intention than any one of these things. It was
growing dark, and the shivering captive began to
realize that he would have to spend the night in
his tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He tucked his knife back safely in its sheath,
and undertook to warm himself a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His snow-shoes he had taken off long before,
and had tied them to a limb, knowing that if they
should fall to the ground the moose would at once
make mince-meat of them. Then he proceeded to
climb about the tree with the utmost energy and
agility, while the moose, who had risen promptly
to his feet, looked on with the most obvious
amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this means Story soon got rid of his chill.
Before it was quite dark he selected a safe and
comparatively comfortable spot where two large
branches forked, and tying himself securely to
the limb with his long scarf, he tried to go to
sleep. It was a profitless undertaking, and after
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
an hour or two of faithful effort he gave it up.
He was stiff, miserable, hungry, and half-frozen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It had grown so dark that he thought perhaps
he might descend the other side of the tree, and
slip away without the moose being any the wiser.
With what he fancied perfect noiselessness, he
tried it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was almost down, when there was a bellow
and a rush, and the animal was almost upon him.
He escaped just by a hair&rsquo;s-breadth, and swung
nimbly back into his refuge. He had no stomach
for another attempt of that sort. He began to
calculate how long it would be before they would
miss him in camp, and come to look for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prospect did not cheer him. Known as
he was for a determined hunter, his comrades
would go home without him, confident that he
would turn up all right when he had bagged his
game. If he was not back by morning they would
perhaps think something had gone wrong, and
set out to look for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would have to retrace their steps to the
moose-yard, and then, picking up his trail from
the yard, might be expected to rescue him about
noon. By that time, he thought to himself miserably,
he might be frozen stiff. He decided to do
something! But what?</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first he thought of cutting a branch, fastening
his knife to the end of it, and stabbing
his captor with the improvised harpoon. But
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
the beech-branches were too thick and crooked to
suit his idea. He did at last, however, succeed
in splicing a sort of spear about five feet long;
and when he had got the knife lashed to the end
of it all his stock of twine was exhausted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spear was pretty satisfactory, but he of
course dared not <i>throw</i> it; and the moose showed
no inclination to come where he could be effectually
and neatly despatched. The hunter struck
his harpoon into a limb, and set out to concoct
another weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time the moon was up. The hunter
tore a little strip from his shirt, wet it in his
mouth, and rubbed it full of gunpowder. This
made a fair bit of slow-match, which he folded
several times longitudinally, and then inserted in
the top of his powder-flask. To the short end,
which he left protruding, he touched a match; and
then he tossed the flask down in front of the
moose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sputtering of the slow-match for a moment
disconcerted the animal, and he drew back. Then,
as if ashamed of his weakness, he sprang upon
the flask and trampled it fiercely under his feet.
While he was indulging in this interesting performance
the powder exploded with a bang, and
the astounded animal sprang high into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But though badly startled, he was not
frightened by any means. He was shocked and
scorched, and a little torn in the fore legs; but
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
this only made him the more deadly. In a paroxysm
of pain and hatred he dashed under the
tree, and rearing frantically struggled to reach
the hunter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was just what the wily woodsman desired.
Lying flat on a branch almost within reach
of the beast&rsquo;s antlers, he reached down and dealt
him a blow in the neck. A second thrust went
deeper, and struck a more vital part, almost under
the throat. The blood gushed out in a torrent,
and the hunter congratulated himself that deliverance
was near at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently the great animal stood still, and
looked about him with a puzzled, anxious air.
He felt his strength going from him, and could
not understand it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon he began to sway from side to side, and
had to brace his feet apart to keep from falling.
At last he fell. Then the hunter, stretching himself,
came down out of the tree and stood beside
his noble and defeated antagonist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Story was too weak and cold and hungry to
think of waiting to cut off the animal&rsquo;s head and
hide it from the bears. He slipped on his snow-shoes,
found his gun, and started back in haste
for the camp. Before daylight he had reached
the &lsquo;yard&rsquo;; and there, to his intense delight, he
met a party of his comrades who had set out in
the night to look for him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<h3>DAN.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you of Dan&rsquo;s
great fight. It was fought before he came into
my possession; that is, before my friend H&mdash;&mdash;,
going away to study in Germany, handed him
over to me. It was just a few weeks before
H&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s departure, and we were setting out for
a farewell trip to the wilderness together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for Dan, he was not much to look at certainly;
and I was prejudiced against him by the
fact that he took up room in the canoe. To carry
a great bulldog in a birch canoe was contrary to
all my notions of the fitness of things. But H&mdash;&mdash; had
protested so vehemently against the idea of
leaving him behind, and the dog had behaved with
such sobriety and good sense when I took him out
to try him in a choppy sea, that I yielded a reluctant
consent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our proposed route was through the chain of
the Chiputneticook Lakes, down stream all the
way, with no difficult water to contend against,
and no bad rapids to shoot. We had two canoes,&mdash;that
which bore H&mdash;&mdash; and myself, and that in
which our Indian carried the baggage; so that
really it was not impossible to make room for the
addition to our party, and Dan was formally enrolled
a member.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took his place in the forward mid-section
of my canoe, immediately behind his master,
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
where he coiled himself up into a compact bundle.
There he calmly ignored the wildest vagaries
to which the lake waves could impel our little
craft. This good seamanship of his, with his dignified
manner toward myself and his adoring devotion
to his master, gradually won my respect;
and before we had been many days out we were
on terms of mutual consideration. I ended with
a cordial enjoyment of his company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I began by declaring that Dan was not
much to look at. This was my first and biassed
impression. But it must be modified by the acknowledgment
that his splendid proportions and
great strength were apparent to the most casual
observer. In fact, he was a perfect specimen of
his breed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the expression of his small eye and mighty
jaw, which certainly belied his true character, was
bloodthirsty to the last degree; and his white
coat was disfigured with a tangle of long scars
which looked as if the business of his life were
brawls. As I afterwards learned, those scars
were the ornament of a hero, no less to be honored
than if his great heart had throbbed in a human
body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was one night in camp at the head of the
Big Chiputneticook that I heard how those scars
were achieved. Tent was pitched on a bit of dry
interval which fringed the base of a high rock,
a well-known landmark to trappers, and distinguished
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
by the name of &lsquo;The Devil&rsquo;s Pulpit.&rsquo;
The rock towered over us, naked and perpendicular,
for a distance of two hundred feet, then
shelved, and rose again some hundreds of feet
farther to a beetling cap of mingled rock and
forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our camp was flanked on each side by a
thicket of cherry and vines and young water-ash,
and the light of our fire filled the space between
with the comfort of its cheerful radiance. In the
midst of this we lay basking, each waiting for
the other to begin a yarn; but no one seemed
prepared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had been out ten days in the wilderness;
and night after night our occupation had been
this one of &lsquo;swapping&rsquo; experiences, till I had
found myself compelled to fall back on my inventive
faculty, and our Indian, Steve, who was communicative
beyond the custom of his people, had
begun to repeat himself in his stories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for H&mdash;&mdash;, he never spun a yarn save under
some strong compulsion, yet we knew more or
less vaguely that many a strange experience had
fallen to his lot. We had had some stirring adventures
together, he and I, since first I had initiated
him into the mysteries of woodcraft. But
it was rare for him to recall them in conversation,
and hence I judged that there was much in his
experience of which I had never heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the present occasion the long silence was
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">229</span>
becoming almost drowsy. For me the flame from
our logs was beginning to change mistily into the
glow from a heaped-up grate, and to play over
two small curly heads and a long-eared pup on
a hearth-rug, when suddenly from far up in the
moonlit rocks of the summit came the wail of
the northern panther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was startled wide-awake; and the little vision
faded instantly into a consciousness of the open
heaven, the white lake, and that lonely, haunted
summit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was not altogether the panther that
had startled me. It was Dan, who had sprung
almost over my head toward the hillside, and now
stood trembling with wrath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the command of his master he stalked back
and sat down again; but he faced the hillside,
and never withdrew his fierce gaze from the spot
whence the sound had seemed to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never mind him, old dog,&rsquo; said H&mdash;&mdash; soothingly;
&lsquo;you can&rsquo;t get at him, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What makes Dan so excited?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;I
never saw him so much worked up before. See,
he&rsquo;s fairly quivering!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; replied H&mdash;&mdash;, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s no love lost between
Dan and the Indian devils. That yelling
stirs up some lively reminiscences in his old pate.
He thinks that Indian devil is coming right down
here to tackle me. See how he keeps me in his
eye! And see him turn his muzzle round now
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">230</span>
and then to lick those scars of his. I&rsquo;ll venture
to say he feels them smart now, when he remembers
the night he got them at the head of the
Little Tobique.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s have it, old man,&rsquo; I urged. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve
never told me about that scrape. I&rsquo;ve been taking
those scars as a certificate of Dan&rsquo;s fighting
propensities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you suppose any <i>dog</i>,&rsquo; said H&mdash;&mdash; in a
tone of disdain, &lsquo;could carve Dan up in that
style? Not by a good deal! It was a big Indian
devil that undertook the contract. He accomplished
the frescoing in a very elaborate fashion,
as you see. But he didn&rsquo;t survive the job.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&mdash;&mdash; compressed his lips, and added, &lsquo;I can
tell you, my dear boy, that was something like an
Indian devil, that fellow, and came mighty near
settling my claims for me. He measured six feet
from tip of nose to tip of tail, and you know what
a poor sort of thing they all have for a tail. It
was Dan saved my life that night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pete and I settled ourselves more comfortably
against our log cushions. Dan, having heard no
more yells from the hilltop, and having perceived
that the conversation concerned himself, curled
himself up with a gratified air, and thrust his
great head into his master&rsquo;s lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You remember,&rsquo; resumed H&mdash;&mdash;, &lsquo;last year
I went to the Tobique all by myself, except for
Dan&rsquo;s company. I was gone six weeks and more.
<span class="pb" id="Page_231">231</span>
When I got back to Fredericton you were off up
Quebec way, and so I never happened to tell you
about the trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I had the best fishing you can conceive
of. It was far better than any we&rsquo;ve ever had
together in those streams. But as for the panthers,
I never heard anything like them. They
used to howl round the woods at night in a
frightful way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dan used to keep awake all night, watching
for them. But they never ventured near the
camp. They didn&rsquo;t disturb me; but if I had not
had Dan with me I might have felt a little shaky,
perhaps, at night. I had rather a contempt for
the brutes at that time, but they were not much
help to a fellow when he was feeling lonely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You know that pretty cove on the right
shore of the Little Tobique, about a hundred
yards from where the brook flows in? On that
patch of open just on top of the bank I pitched
my tent. By the time the camp was fixed, and
the fish fried for supper, it was getting pretty
well past sundown. It was a gorgeous moonlight
night, as bright as day. There wasn&rsquo;t a mosquito
about. I tell you I felt pretty nice as I lifted the
pink flakes of fried trout onto my plate, and fixed
a dish for Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was getting out the hardtack, when I saw
a whopping big trout jump, just by the mouth of
the brook. It was bigger than any I had caught
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
so far, and I could not bear to lose the chance of
taking him while he was feeding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I set down my plate, telling Dan to watch
it, seized my rod, tied on a cast of white and gray
millers, and struck hurriedly through the bushes
toward the other side of the cove, where I thought
I could get a fair cast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You know what sort of a place that shore is,&mdash;all
banks and bowlders, and thickets and little
gullies; and some of those gullies are hidden by
fallen trees, or grown over with weeds and vines.
You have to keep your eyes open, or you are
liable to tumble into these pitfalls. I was in a
hurry, and plunged right ahead. I wanted to
catch that trout and get back to my supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At last, about sixty or seventy yards from
the camp, I dodged round a thick fir-bush, and
saw right in front of me something that brought
me up mighty short, I can tell you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not ten feet away, crouched along the top
of a white bowlder, lay a huge Indian devil just
ready to spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I felt queer right down to my boots, but
kept my eyes fixed on those of the brute, which
gleamed like two emeralds in the moonlight. My
right hand reached for my belt, and I stealthily
drew my old sheath-knife. At the same time I
whistled sharply for Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The brute was on the very point of springing
when I whistled; but the shrill sound startled him,
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">233</span>
and deterred him for a moment. He glanced uneasily
from side to side, half rising. Then he
drew himself together again for his spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Before he could launch himself forth, I
hurled the butt of my fishing-rod full in his face,
and sprang aside. I saw the long body flash
toward me, and at the same instant I crashed
through a tangle of underbrush, and sank into
one of those gullies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Instinctively I threw out my left arm to save
myself. My grasp caught a tree-root on the edge
of the hole. The next instant I felt the panther&rsquo;s
teeth sink into my arm. I didn&rsquo;t know how deep
that hole was, but I wanted to be at the bottom
of it right away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At the risk of stabbing myself, I slashed
desperately above my head with my free right
hand. It was not a breath too soon; for at that
very instant the brute had reached down with the
amiable intention of clawing my head. The knife
went through his paw, which he snatched back,
snarling fiercely. But he kept his grip on my
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then I heard Dan come tearing through the
brush. I lunged again, blindly of course; and this
time the blade went through the panther&rsquo;s jaw
and into my own flesh. The brute let go; and I
rolled to the foot of the gully, a distance of some
five or six feet. Even as I fell I heard Dan&rsquo;s vindictive
cough as he sank his teeth into his adversary&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">234</span>
throat. There was a mad snarl from the
big cat, a struggle&mdash;and the two rolled down on
top of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I got out of the way in a great hurry. At
first it was too dark down there to distinguish the
combatants. In a moment, however, my eyes got
used to the gloom. The two animals were almost
inextricably mixed up. Dan&rsquo;s grip was right
under the panther&rsquo;s jaw, so that he could not
make any use of his teeth. The wary old dog
had drawn himself up into a tight ball, so as to
expose as little of himself as possible to the attack
of his enemy&rsquo;s claws. But his back and haunches
were getting terribly mangled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dan fought in silence; but the Indian devil
made noise enough for both, and the yelling down
in that little hole was fiendish. I felt my left
arm, and found it was not broken. Then I sprang
on the Indian devil, seized him by the tail, and
tried to jerk his hind legs clear of Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;His back was bowed up into a half-circle,
and there was no unbending that arch of steel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I dug the knife twice into his side, and he
paid no attention to it, so absorbed was he in the
life-and-death struggle with Dan. If left to themselves
I saw that the fight would end with the
death of both. Dan was inexorably working
through the throat of his foe, but was in a fair
way to be torn to pieces before he could get this
accomplished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I threw myself on the panther&rsquo;s hindquarters,
twining my left arm around his supple loins,
and with my right hand I reached for his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;See the length of this blade? I drove it in
to the hilt three times behind that brute&rsquo;s fore
shoulder before I fetched him. Then he straightened
out and fell over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was some time before I could persuade
Dan to drop him. The poor old fellow was so
torn he could hardly walk. I picked him up in
my arms,&mdash;though it&rsquo;s no joke to carry a dog of
his weight,&mdash;and lugged him back to the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We were a sight to see when we got there, a
mass of blood from head to foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I stayed at that camp four days, nursing Dan
and myself, before we were able to start for home;
and then we <i>had</i> to go, for fear we&rsquo;d be starved
out. I thanked my stars and your old-time injunctions
that I had taken the little medicine-case
along with me. It might have gone hard with us
but for that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As H&mdash;&mdash; concluded, Pete grunted in astonishment
and admiration. Indeed, these expressive
grunts of his had furnished a running fire of comment
throughout the narrative. For myself, I
fetched a deep breath, got up, and went over to
embrace Dan. As I rose, I cast my eyes up the
mountain, and exclaimed,&mdash;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Talk of angels and you&rsquo;ll see their wings, eh?
Look there!&rsquo; H&mdash;&mdash; and Pete followed my gaze.
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
Far up, in the whiteness of the moonlight, we saw
a stealthy form creep across a surface of bare rock.
Dan saw it too, and every muscle became rigid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The form disappeared in a thick covert, and a
moment later there issued again upon the stillness
that strange, blood-curdling cry. It sounded like
a challenge to the hero of H&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the challenge went unheeded. H&mdash;&mdash; ordered
Dan into the tent. In a few minutes we
were wrapped in our blankets, and the panthers
had the wilderness all to themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;What became of Dan at last?&rdquo; inquired
Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poisoned three years ago; but I made the
brutes that did it smart for it!&rdquo; said I, shutting
my teeth with a snap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hanging would have been none too bad for
them!&rdquo; growled Stranion. From this the talk
wandered to dogs in general; and each man, of
course, sang the praises of his own, till presently
Stranion cried, &ldquo;Douse the glim!&rdquo; and we rolled
into our blankets.</p>

<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">THE CAMP ON THE TOLEDI.</span></h2>
<p>In the morning we set out at a reasonable hour,
planning to camp that night at the foot of Toledi
Lake. The last few miles of the Squatook River
were easy paddling, save that here and there a
fallen tree was in the way. In passing these obstructions
Stranion proved unlucky. His canoe
led the procession, with himself standing erect,
alert, pole in hand, in the stern, while Queerman
sat lazily in the bow. At length we saw ahead of
us a tree-trunk stretching across the channel. By
ducking our heads down to the gunwales there was
room to pass under it. But Stranion tried a piece
of gymnastics, like a circus-rider jumping through
a hoop. He attempted to step over the trunk
while the canoe was passing under it. In this he
partly succeeded. He got one foot over, according
to calculation, and landed it safely in the canoe.
But as for the other&mdash;well, a malicious little projecting
branch took hold of it by the moccasin, and
held on with the innate pertinacity of inanimate
things. The canoe wouldn&rsquo;t wait, so Stranion remained
behind with his captive foot. He dropped
head-first into the water, whence we rescued him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>The next time we came to an obstruction of
this kind Stranion didn&rsquo;t try to step over it. He
stooped to go under it. But another malicious
branch now came to the front. The branch was
long, strong, and sharp. It reached down, seized
the back of Stranion&rsquo;s shirt, and almost dragged
him out of the canoe. Failing in this,&mdash;for Stranion&rsquo;s
blood was up,&mdash;it ripped the shirt open,
and ploughed a long red furrow down his back.
It took an ocean of glycerine and arnica to assuage
that wound.</p>
<p>On the upper Toledi we found a brisk wind
blowing. Hoisting improvised sails, we sped down
the lake without labor. On the lower lake (the
two sheets of water are separated only by a short
&ldquo;thoroughfare&rdquo;) the wind failed us, and we had
to resume our paddling. It was late in a golden,
hazy afternoon when we drew near the outlet.</p>
<p>Here we overhauled an ancient Indian who had
been visiting his traps up the lake. We recognized
him as one &ldquo;Old Martin,&rdquo; a well-known hunter
and trapper. He was plying his paddle with
philosophic deliberation in the stern of the most
dilapidated old canoe I have ever seen afloat. His
salutation to us was a grunt; but when we invited
him to camp near us and have a bit of supper
with us he, quickly became more civil.</p>
<p>Round the camp-fire that night, with a good supper
comforting his stomach, Old Martin forgot
the red man&rsquo;s taciturnity. Sam was busy frying
<span class="pb" id="Page_239">239</span>
tobacco, while the rest of us lounged about in
the glow, testing the results of these culinary experiments.
It will be remembered that when the
upset took place at Squatook Falls, our tobacco
was almost all shut up in a certain tin box which
we fondly fancied to be water-proof. When the
little store in the other canoes was exhausted, we
turned to this tin box. Alas, that box was just
so far water-proof as to let in the water and keep
it from running out! We found a truly delectable
mess inside. Sam had undertaken to dry
this mess, out of which all the benign quality was
pretty well steeped. He pressed it therefore, and
rolled it tenderly, and spread it out in the frying-pan
over a gentle fire, until it was quite dry. But
oh, it was not good to smoke! Keeping a little
to trifle with, we bestowed all the rest of it upon
the poor Indian, whose untutored mind led him
to accept it gratefully. Perchance he threw it
away when our backs were turned.</p>
<p>Suddenly Sam&rsquo;s task was interrupted by a
wailing, desolate, and terrible cry, coming apparently
from the shores of the upper lake. We
gazed at each other with wide eyes, and instinctively
drew nearer the fire; while Sam cried, &ldquo;Ugh,
what&rsquo;s that? it must be Cerberus himself got
loose!&rdquo; Old Martin grunted, &ldquo;Glusk&acirc;p&rsquo;s hunting-dog!
Big storm bime-by, mebbe!&rdquo; He looked
awed, but not afraid. He said it would not come
near us. It was heard sometimes in the night
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">240</span>
and far off, as now, but no man of the present
days had ever seen the dog. It ranged up and
down throughout these regions, howling for its
master, whom now it would never find. For
Glusk&acirc;p had been struck down in a deep valley
north of the St. Lawrence, and a mountain placed
upon him, so that neither could he stir nor anybody
find him. So Martin explained that grim
sound.</p>
<p>We learned afterwards that the cry was one
of the rarer utterances of the loon; but had any
one told us so that night we would not have
believed him. We preferred to accept the weird
notion of the faithful phantom hound seeking
forever his vanished master, the beneficent Indian
demigod.</p>
<p>About the time supper was done the weather
had changed. While Sam was frying his tobacco,
the soft summery sweetness fled from the air, and
a cold wind set in, blowing down out of the north.
It was a strange and unseasonable wind, and
pierced our bones. We heaped the camp-fire to
a threefold height, and huddled in our blankets
between the blaze and the lee of the tent. Then
Stranion was called on for a story.</p>
<h3>TRACKED BY A PANTHER.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the air bites shrewdly. It is
a nipping and an eager air. In fact, it puts me
forcibly in mind of one of my best adventures,
<span class="pb" id="Page_241">241</span>
which befell me that winter when I was trapping
on the Little Sou&rsquo;west Miramichi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come! Tell us a good <i>summer</i> story, old
man,&rdquo; interrupted Queerman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m half-frozen
as it is, to-night. Tell us about some place down
in the tropics where they have to cool their porridge
with boiling water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; replied Stranion; &ldquo;my thoughts are
wintry, and even so must my story be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He traced in the air a few meditative circles
with his pipe (which he rarely smoked, using it
rather for oratorical effect), and then resumed:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a hard winter of mine on the Little
Sou&rsquo;west. I enjoyed it at the time, and it did me
good; but, looking back upon it now, I wonder
what induced me to undertake it. I got the experience,
and I indulged my hobby to the full;
but by spring I felt like a barbarian. It is a fine
thing, boys, as we all agree, to be an amateur
woodsman, and it brings a fellow very close to
nature; but it is much more sport in summer than
in winter, and it&rsquo;s better when one has good company
than when he&rsquo;s no one to talk to but a preternaturally
gloomy Melicite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had No&euml;l with me that winter,&mdash;a good
hunter and true, but about as companionable as
a mud-turtle. Our traps were set in two great
circuits, one on the south side of the stream, the
other on the north. The range to the north was
in my own charge, and a very big charge it was.
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">242</span>
When I had any sort of luck, it used to take me
a day and a half to make the round; for I had
seventeen traps to tend, spread out over a range
of about twenty miles. But when the traps were
not well filled, I used to do it without sleeping
away from camp. It&rsquo;s not much like play, I can
tell you, tramping all day on snow-shoes through
those woods, carrying an axe, a fowling-piece,
food, ammunition, and sometimes a pack of furs.
Whenever I had to sleep out, I would dig a big
oblong hole in the snow, build a roaring fire at
one end of the hole, bury myself in hemlock
boughs at the other end, and snooze like a dormouse
till morning. I relied implicitly on the fire
to keep off any bears or Indian devils that might
be feeling inquisitive as to whether I would be
good eating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The snow must have been fully six feet deep
that year. One morning near the last of February
I had set out on my round, and had made
some three miles from our shanty, when I caught
sight of a covey of partridges in the distance, and
turned out of my way to get a shot at them. It
had occurred to me that perchance a brace of them
might make savory morsels for my supper. After
a considerable <i>d&eacute;tour</i>, I bagged my birds, and recovered
my trail near the last trap I had visited.
My tracks, as I had left them, had been solitary
enough; but now I found they were accompanied
by the footprints of a large Indian devil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really expect to get a shot at the
beast, but I loaded both barrels with ball-cartridges.
As I went on, however, it began to
strike me as strange that the brute should happen
to be going so far in my direction. Step for step
his footprints clung to mine. When I reached
the place where I had branched off in search of
the partridges, I found that the panther had
branched off with me. So polite a conformity
of his ways to mine could have but one significance.
I was being tracked!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea, when it first struck me, struck me
with too much force to be agreeable. It was a
very unusual proceeding on the part of an Indian
devil, displaying a most imperfect conception of
the fitness of things. That I should hunt him
was proper and customary, but that he should
think of hunting me was presumptuous and most
unpleasant. I resolved that he should be made to
repent it before night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The traps were unusually successful that trip,
and at last I had to stop and make a <i>cache</i> of my
spoils. This unusual delay seemed to mislead my
wily pursuer, who suddenly came out of a thicket
while I was hidden behind a tree-trunk. As he
crept stealthily along on my tracks, not fifty yards
away, I was disgusted at his sleuth-hound persistence
and crafty malignity. I raised my gun
to my shoulder, and in another moment would
have rid myself of his undesired attentions, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
the animal must have caught a gleam from the
shining barrels, for he turned like a flash, and
buried himself in the nearest thicket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was evident that he did not wish the matter
forced to an immediate issue. As a consequence,
I decided that it ought to be settled at
once. I ran toward the thicket; but at the same
time the panther stole out on the other side, and
disappeared in the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon this I concluded that he had become
scared, and given up his unhallowed purpose.
For some hours I dismissed him from my mind,
and tended my traps without further apprehension.
But about the middle of the afternoon, or
a little later, when I had reached the farthest
point on my circuit, I once more became impressed
with a sense that I was being followed. The impression
grew so strong that it weighed upon me,
and I determined to bring it to a test. Taking
some luncheon from my pocket, I sat down behind
a tree to nibble and wait. I suppose I must
have sat there ten minutes, hearing nothing, seeing
nothing, so that I was about to give it up, and
continue my tramp, when&mdash;along came the panther!
My gun was levelled instantly, but at that
same instant the brute had disappeared. His eyes
were sharper than mine. &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said I to myself,
&lsquo;I shall have to keep a big fire going to-night,
or this fellow will pay me a call when I am snoring!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, surely not!&rdquo; murmured Queerman pensively.
The rest of us laughed; but Stranion only
waved his pipe with a gesture that commanded
silence, and went on:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About sundown I met with an unlucky accident,
which dampened both my spirits and my
powder. In crossing a swift brook, at a place
where the ice was hardly thick enough to hold
up its covering of snow, I broke through and was
soaked. After fishing myself out with some difficulty,
I found my gun was full of water which
had frozen as it entered. Here was a pretty fix!
The weapon was for the present utterly useless.
I feared that most of my cartridges were in like
condition. The prospect for the night, when the
Indian devil should arrive upon the scene, was not
a cheerful one. I pushed on miserably for another
mile or so, and then prepared to camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all, I built such a fire as I thought
would impress upon the Indian devil a due sense
of my importance and my mysterious powers.
At a safe distance from the fire I spread out my
cartridges to dry, in the fervent hope that the
water had not penetrated far enough to render
them useless. My gun I put where it would
thaw as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I cut enough firewood to blaze all
night. With my snow-shoes I dug a deep hollow
at one side of the fire. The fire soon melted the
snow beneath it, and brought it down to the level
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">246</span>
whereon I was to place my couch. I may say
that the ground I had selected was a gentle slope,
and the fire was below my bed, so that the melting
snow could run off freely. Over my head
I fixed a good, firm &lsquo;lean-to&rsquo; of spruce saplings,
thickly thatched with boughs. Thus I secured
myself in such a way that the Indian devil could
come at me only from the side on which the fire
was burning. Such approach, I congratulated myself,
would be little to his Catship&rsquo;s taste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the time my shelter was completed, it was
full night in the woods. My fire made a ruddy
circle about the camp, and presently I discerned
the panther gliding in and out among the tree-trunks
on the outer edges of the circle. He
stared at me with his round green eyes, and I
returned the gaze with cold indifference. I was
busy putting my gun in order. I would not
encourage him, lest he might grow too familiar
before I was ready for his reception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between my gleaming walls of snow I had
worked up a temperature that was fairly tropical.
Away up overhead, among the pine-tops, a few
large stars glimmered lonesomely. How far away
seemed the world of my friends on whom these
same stars were looking down! I wondered how
those at home would feel if they could see me
there by my solitary camp-fire, watched relentlessly
by that prowling and vindictive beast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently, finding that I made no attack upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
him, the brute slipped noiselessly up to within a
dozen paces of the fire. There he crouched down
in the snow and glared upon me. I hurled a
flaming brand at him, and he sprang backward,
snarling, into the gloom. But the brand spluttered
in the snow and went out, whereupon the
brute returned to his post. Then I threw another
at him; but he regarded it this time with contempt,
merely drawing aside to give it room.
When it had gone black out, he approached,
pawed it over, and sniffed in supremest contempt.
Then he came much nearer, so that I thought
he was about to spring upon me. I moved discreetly
to the other side of the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time the gun was ready for action,
but not so the cartridges. They were lying
farther from the fire and dangerously near my
unwelcome visitor. I perceived that I must make
a diversion at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Selecting a resinous stick into which the fire
had eaten deeply, so that it held a mass of glowing
coals, I launched it suddenly with such careful
aim that it struck right between the brute&rsquo;s
fore-legs. As it scorched there, he caught and bit
at it angrily, dropped it with a screaming snarl,
and shrank farther away. When he crouched
down, biting the snow, I followed up my advantage
by rushing upon him with a blazing roll
of birch-bark. He did not await my onset, but
bounded off among the trees, where I could hear
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">248</span>
him grumbling in the darkness over his smarting
mouth. I left the bark blazing in the snow while
I went back to see to my precious cartridges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before long the panther reappeared at the
limits of the lighted circle, but seemed not quite
so confident as before. Nevertheless, it was clear
that he had set his heart on making a meal of
me, and was not to be bluffed out of his design by
a few firebrands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I discovered that all my ball-cartridges were
spoiled; but there were a few loaded with shot
which the water had not penetrated. From these
I withdrew the shot, and substituted ball and
slugs. Then, slipping a ball-cartridge into one
barrel, slugs into the other, and three or four
extra cartridges into a handy pocket, I waited
for my opponent to recover his confidence. As
he seemed content to wait a while, I set about
broiling my partridges, for I was becoming clamorously
hungry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So also was the panther, as it seemed. When
the odor of those partridges stole seductively to
his nostrils, he once more approached my fire; and
this time with an air of stern determination quite
different from his former easy insolence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crisis had come. I seized my gun, and
knelt down behind the fire. I arranged a burning
log in such a manner that I could grasp and
wield it with both hands in an emergency. Just
as the animal drew himself together for a spring,
I fired one barrel,&mdash;that containing the ball,&mdash;and
shattered his lower jaw. Mad with pain and
fury, he sprang. The contents of my second barrel,
a heavy charge of slugs, met him full in
the breast, and he fell in a heap at my feet.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">

<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Mad with Pain and Fury, He sprang.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Page 249.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>&ldquo;As he lay there, struggling and snarling and
tearing up the snow, I slipped in another cartridge;
and the next moment a bullet in his brain
put an end to his miseries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this performance, I ate my partridges
with a very grateful heart, and slept the sleep
of the just and the victorious. The skin of that
audacious Indian devil lies now in my study,
where Sam is continually desecrating it with his
irreverent shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Good story, Stranion,&rdquo; said Magnus with grave
approval. &ldquo;The only thing hard to believe is that
you should make two such good shots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see I had to,&rdquo; responded Stranion.
&ldquo;And now let Magnus give us a hot story to
satisfy Queerman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I know another tropical yarn,&rdquo;
said Magnus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you one,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;and a bear story
it is too. It&rsquo;s about a scrape I got into when I
was down in Florida three years ago, looking after
Uncle Bill&rsquo;s oranges. I&rsquo;ll call it&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<h3>&lsquo;AN ADVENTURE IN THE FLORIDA HUMMOCKS.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I was boarding at a country house not far
from the banks of the Caloosahatchee River, in a
district full of game. Most of my time was spent
in wandering with gun and dog through the luxuriant
woods that clothed the hummocks, and
along the edges of the waving savannas or interval
meadows. The dog which always accompanied
me was a large mongrel, half setter and
half Newfoundland, belonging to my landlord.
He was plucky and intelligent, but untrained;
and I used to take him rather as a companion
than as an assistant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The soil in Florida is generally very sandy;
but in the hummocks, or, as they are more usually
called in Florida, &lsquo;hammocks,&rsquo; the sand is mixed
with clay, and carries a heavy growth of timber.
The trees are chiefly dogwood, pine, magnolia,
and the several species of oak which grow in the
South. These &lsquo;hammocks&rsquo; vary in extent from
one or two to a thousand or more acres, and in
many places the trees are so interlaced with rankly
growing vines that one can penetrate the forest
only by the narrow cattle-paths leading to the
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One afternoon I was threading a path which
led through a particularly dense hummock to the
bank of a wide, shallow stream, known as Dogwood
Creek, a branch of the Caloosahatchee. I
<span class="pb" id="Page_251">251</span>
carried a light double-barrelled fowling-piece, and
was seeking no game more formidable than wild
turkeys. My cartridges were loaded with No. 2
shot, but I had taken the precaution to drop a
couple of ball-cartridges in among the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently there was a heavy crashing amid
the dense undergrowth on my right; and Bruce,
the dog, who had dropped a few paces behind,
drew quickly up to my side with an angry growl.
The hair lifted along his back and between his
ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the crashing rapidly came nearer,&mdash;startlingly
near, in fact,&mdash;I made haste to remove my
light cartridges and replace them with ball. But,
alas! to unload was one thing, to find one of those
two ball-cartridges in the crowded depths of my
capacious pocket was quite another. Every cartridge
I brought to light was marked, with exasperating
plainness, No. 2.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my eager haste the perspiration stood out
all over my face. I knew well enough what was
coming. It was unquestionably a bear. A panther
would move more quietly; and a stray steer would
cause no such great concern to Bruce. Whatever
may have been my emotions, surprise was certainly
not among them when, just as I had concluded
that those two ball-cartridges must have
been a dream, a huge bear, which seemed very
angry about something, burst mightily forth into
the pathway only three or four yards behind me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was not hard to decide what to do. On
either hand was the thicket, to me practically impenetrable;
and behind was the bear. Straight
ahead I ran at the top of my speed. At the same
time I managed to slip a couple of cartridges into
my gun. They were just whatever ones came to
my hand; but devoutly I hoped against hope that
they might prove, when tested, to be those which
were loaded with ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For perhaps two or three hundred yards the
running was distinctly in my favor, but then the
pace began to tell on me. At once I slackened
speed, and my pursuer closed in upon me so
swiftly that I concluded to try a snap shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Facing about with a sharp yell, I expected the
bear to rise on his hind legs and give me a fair
chance for a shot. But I had miscalculated my
own momentum. The bear, indeed, rose as I expected.
But at the same instant I tripped on a
root and fell headlong. The gun flew up in the
air in a wonderful way, and disappeared in the
undergrowth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To recover it was, I knew, impossible. Almost
before I touched the ground I was on my feet
again, and running faster than ever. But what
refuge there was for me to run to I knew not,
and how the affair was going to end I dared not
guess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first burst of my renewed vigor, and
while the bear was recovering from his natural
<span class="pb" id="Page_253">253</span>
surprise at my extraordinary man&oelig;uvre, I had
regained my lost ground. All at once, as my
breath was about forsaking me, the path opened
before my eyes upon a grassy savanna, beyond
which shone the waters of Dogwood Creek. At
the water&rsquo;s edge was drawn up an old flat boat,
with a pole sticking out over the bow. This craft
was evidently used as a ferry to connect with a
continuation of the path on the other side of the
creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I darted forward, thrust the punt off, and
flung myself into it. An energetic push with the
pole, and the little craft shot out into the stream.
Bruce, meanwhile, ran up along the water&rsquo;s edge,
barking furiously, and the bear pursued him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calling the dog to come to me, I pushed the
punt towards him. With a frightened whine,
which I did not at the moment understand, he
plunged into the water and swam out bravely.
The bear hesitated a second or two, and then
dashed in after him, raising a tremendous splash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Bruce was within a couple of yards
of the boat, I was enlightened as to the cause of
his reluctance to take the water. An ugly black
snout, not unlike the butt of a water-logged timber,
was thrust into view close by; then another,
a few feet below the desperately swimming animal;
then another, and yet another, till the sullen,
whitish surface of the creek was dotted thickly
with the heads of alligators. They had evidently
<span class="pb" id="Page_254">254</span>
been attracted by the sound of Bruce&rsquo;s barking;
and I called to mind some stories I had heard at
the house as to the abundance and ferocity of the
alligators in Dogwood Creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sturdy shove on the pole, and I was at
Bruce&rsquo;s side. Reaching over, I seized him by the
scruff of the neck, and jerked him into the boat,
just as a tremendous swirl in the water behind
him showed where an alligator had made a rush
for his legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next instant the snout of the disappointed
animal shot up beside the gunwale, to receive a
fierce jab from my pole, which made it keep its
distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time the bear was dangerously near at
hand. He was approaching with great wallowing
plunges, the water not being deep enough to compel
him to swim. I began to pole with all my
might, thinking that even yet I was far from being
out of the difficulty. With a few thrusts I
put a safe distance between myself and my pursuer,
but the creek was not wide enough to enable
me to gain any very great head start in this way.
In a most discontented frame of mind I had
almost reached the landing, when suddenly it occurred
to me that really there was no necessity for
me to land at once. I could pole up and down
the creek, and dodge the bear until he should get
tired and give up the chase. With this purpose I
thrust out again boldly into mid-stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>&ldquo;The bear was now almost half-way across, but
those black snouts were closing about him ominously.
Indeed, the animal must have been blinded
with rage, or he would never have ventured into
the deadly stream. In a moment, however, it
seemed to dawn upon him that he had got himself
into trouble. He stopped with an uneasy sort of
whine. Then he turned, and made for the shore
as fast as he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was too late for him to escape in that
way. His path was blocked by several of the
great reptiles, whose appetites were now thoroughly
aroused. I thought to myself, &lsquo;If that
bear is game, there&rsquo;s going to be a lively time
around here just now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he <i>was</i> game. True, seeing that the
odds were so overwhelmingly against him, he had
at first tried to avoid the combat. But now that
he was fairly in for it, he acquitted himself in a
way that soon won my sympathetic admiration,
and made me forget that but a moment before he
had been thirsting for my own blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a huge grunt of indignant defiance, the
bear hurled himself upon the nearest alligator.
On the massive armor of the reptile&rsquo;s back even
his powerful claws made slight impression; but
with one paw he reached to the soft under-side
of the throat, and the water was suddenly crimsoned,
as the alligator, lashing the surface with his
tail, made off and took refuge in a bed of reeds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>&ldquo;At the same instant, however, the jaws of
another assailant closed upon the animal&rsquo;s flank.
With a roar he rose straight up in the water,
shaking himself so mightily that his adversary&rsquo;s
hold was broken. Then he threw his whole bulk
on another which was advancing against him in
front. The alligator was borne under and disappeared,
probably forever <i>hors de combat</i>, and the
bear gained several yards toward safety. Then
others crowded in upon him, and his progress was
stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up to this time my sympathies had naturally
been with the alligators, to whom I owed my release
from an embarrassing situation. Now, however,
I felt myself going over to the side of the
bear. I hated to see the splendid, though to me
very objectionable, brute thus at the mercy of a
horde of ravening reptiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again shaking off his assailants, the bear
seemed merely bent on selling his life as dearly
as possible. Rising on his hindquarters, he faced
toward the centre of the stream, where his foes
were most numerous. What tremendous buffeting
blows he dealt, and how the strong knife-edged
hooks of his claws searched out the unarmored
spots on his adversaries! In my excitement I
pushed perilously near, and if I had had my lost
gun I should certainly have taken a hand in the
contest myself. I would have given a good deal
at that moment to be able to help the bear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>&ldquo;But the odds were too great for any strength
or pluck to long contend against. Before many
minutes the bear was dragged under, and there
was nothing to be seen but a heaving, lashing,
foaming mass of alligators. On the outskirts of
the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> swam a few hungry reptiles, who could
not get in to the division of the spoils. These
presently turned their attention to the boat, purposing
to console themselves with Bruce and me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awaking to the peril of the situation, I
began poling hurriedly toward the landing-place
whence I had first started. But almost instantly
I was surrounded with alligators. Excited and
enraged from their battle with the bear, they were
much more formidable than at ordinary times.
I had great reason to be thankful for the skill
in poling which I had acquired in the birch-bark
canoes of our Northern rivers. Dodging some of
my assailants, I beat off others with the pole,
thrusting fiercely at their wicked little eyes,
which is the surest way to daunt them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All at once there was a wild yelp from Bruce,
and the punt reeled sharply. The gunwale went
under water, and I was all but pitched out head-first
into the swarm of alligators. My heart was
in my mouth as, with a swift and violent motion
of the pole, I recovered my balance, and steadied
the boat. But with all my terror I had room for
a pang of grief as I saw that poor Bruce had been
dragged overboard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>&ldquo;The capture of the dog, however, was probably
my salvation. The alligators which were in front
of the boat darted into the scramble which was
taking place over the new victim, and I saw a
clear space between me and the safety of the
shore. Desperately I surged on the pole, and
the light craft shot in among the sedges. As the
prow lifted onto solid ground, several of the long
snouts rose over the stern, snapping greedily; but
I had bounded forward like lightning, and was
beyond their reach in a second. I paused not till
I was clear of the savanna and among the timber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throwing myself down on the reeking mould
of the path, I lay there till I had recovered my
breath, and a measure of my equanimity. Then,
after finding my gun in the depths of a mimosa
thicket, I wended my way homeward, much depressed
over the fate of Bruce.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Talking of dogs,&rdquo; said Queerman, &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> tell
you a story with a dog in it. And it&rsquo;s got other
things in it too. A college story, by way of a
change. Come to think of it, though we are all
college men, there has been very little in our
stories to indicate the fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means, Kelly Queerman,&rdquo; said Sam,
&ldquo;let&rsquo;s have the college story at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to give it a proper scholastic flavor, I
will entitle it&mdash;</p>

<h3>&lsquo;THE JUNIOR LATIN SCHOLARSHIP.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The sunshine of mid-May streamed alluringly
into the great stone portico of the old college
of X&mdash;&mdash;. The wide-winged gray edifice stood
on a high terrace just under the crest of the hill,
its ample windows looking down over the topmost
boughs of ash and elm and maple over the
roofs and spires of the little university town of
X&mdash;&mdash;, and out to the broad blue curve of the
placid river. On the steps, lounged a group of
students, members of the Senior and Junior years.
Several of the loiterers stood close to the open,
arched door, and from time to time glanced expectantly
into the hall. A large black dog, a
cross between Spitz and Newfoundland, lay in
the centre of the hall, assiduously licking at a
small but angry wound on his leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the farther end of the hall now appeared
one of the professors. He stepped in front of the
notice-board, and pinned a slip of white paper to
the green baize-covered surface. In a moment
the portico was cleared; and the men crowded in
to read the announcement. They did not rush
noisily, as Freshmen, or even Sophomores, might
have done; but their eagerness was tempered with
dignity. The Seniors, in particular, were careful
to be properly deliberate; for announcements
were expected by both classes, and this might
prove to be merely a Junior list!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>was</i> a Junior list. Leaning on each other&rsquo;s
shoulders, the Juniors clustered around the board,
while the Seniors lingered on the outskirts, and
inquired with polite interest about the results.
They were mindful that these Juniors would very
soon be Seniors, and were therefore to be treated
with a good deal of consideration. Then they
dropped away in twos and threes, while the Juniors
remained to take down the marks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The marks which excited so much interest
were those of the third terminal examination in
Latin. A Latin scholarship, of the value of one
hundred dollars, was dependent on the results of
three terminals, compulsory for all the Latin students
of the Junior class, and on a special examination
to be held at the very end of the term.
This examination was open only to those declaring
themselves competitors for the scholarship.
It was generally expected throughout the college
that the winner would be Bert Knollys, who,
without effort, had gained a slight lead in the first
two terminals, and whose ability in classics was
unquestioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the top of the present announcement
stood Knollys&rsquo;s name with percentage of eighty-six.
The second name on the list was that of
J. S. Wright, with eighty-three to his credit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wright&rsquo;s pulling up! Five more points will
put him ahead!&rsquo; was the remark of one man
who had been figuring on his pad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wright, a sharp-featured, sandy-haired fellow
in the centre of the group, nodded his approval of
this calculation. At the same moment, a slim
youth of barely middle height, with laughing gray
eyes and crisply-waving hair, ran up and peered
eagerly through the throng of his comrades. Having
deciphered his standing, he was turning away
as abruptly as he had come, when some one
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;d better look out, Knollys! Wright is
after you with a sharp stick!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt Jack can beat me if he tries!&rsquo;
responded Knollys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hold on a minute, Bert; I want to talk to
you a bit!&rsquo; exclaimed a tall Junior by the name
of Will Allison, extricating himself quickly from
the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Next hour, old man!&rsquo; cried Knollys, darting
away. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got to catch Dawson in the laboratory,
right off, and can&rsquo;t wait a second!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allison, who was Knollys&rsquo;s most intimate
friend, crossed the hall, and joined a Senior who
was lounging in a window overlooking the terrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s my firm belief, Jones,&rsquo; said he discontentedly,
&lsquo;that that cad, Jack Wright, is going to
play Bert false!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How so, pray?&rsquo; inquired the Senior, in a
tone of very moderate interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, by going into the special exam., of
course!&rsquo; replied Allison.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And why <i>shouldn&rsquo;t</i> he, as well as Knollys,
go into the special examination?&rsquo; asked Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I thought every one knew about that!&rsquo;
exclaimed Allison somewhat impatiently. &lsquo;But
it&rsquo;s this way, since you inquire. Wright took the
scholarship for our class last year&mdash;the Second
Year Greek, you know. Well, Knollys was way
ahead on the average of the terminals, and would
have had a walk-over. As every man in the class
knows, he can wipe out all the rest of us in classics
without half trying. But Wright went to
him, and made a poor mouth about being so hard
up that he&rsquo;d have to leave college if he didn&rsquo;t get
the scholarship. Bert has none too much cash
himself; but in his generous way he agreed not to
go in for the special exam. So Wright, of course,
got the scholarship. In return he promised Knollys
that he would not go in for the Junior Latin the
following year. This suited Bert very well, as he
wanted to put his hard work on his readings for
the science medal. Under these circumstances,
you see, he has been taking it rather easy in the
Latin; and I have reason to believe that Wright
has been working extra hard at it. Mark my
words, he&rsquo;ll go in at the last moment and catch
Bert napping. But there&rsquo;s not another man in college
that I would suspect of such a caddish trick.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, for my part,&rdquo; said the Senior, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
greatly care which gets it. I grant you that
Wright&rsquo;s a cad; but I&rsquo;m disappointed in Knollys!&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Indeed! Poor Knollys!&rsquo; murmured Allison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; continued the Senior loftily, ignoring
the sarcasm; &lsquo;in my opinion Knollys funks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It seems to me, Jones,&rsquo; retorted Allison, &lsquo;you
forget certain incidents that took place when
Bert Knollys was a Freshman, and you a Sophomore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said the Senior, calmly looking over
Allison&rsquo;s head, &lsquo;the worm will turn! But what
I&rsquo;m thinking about is his refusal to play foot-ball
last fall. He&rsquo;s quick, and sharp, and tough; just
the man the team wanted for quarter-back, if only
he had the nerve! Said he was too busy to
train&mdash;indeed!&rsquo; and Jones sniffed contemptuously
as he turned away to join some members of his
own class, leaving Allison in a fume of indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this moment Jack Wright, chancing to
stroll past the big black dog, gave the animal a careless
kick. The dog sprang at his assailant with a
ferocious snarl. Much startled, Wright evaded the
attack by dodging into a knot of his classmates;
and the dog lay down again, growling angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bran doesn&rsquo;t seem to be quite himself!&rsquo; remarked
a Senior, eying him narrowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;d be an ugly customer to handle if he
started to run amuck,&rsquo; commented another Senior,
chuckling at Wright&rsquo;s discomfiture. &lsquo;I wonder
where he got that bite on his leg!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was something which nobody knew; and
the incident was promptly forgotten by all but
<span class="pb" id="Page_264">264</span>
Jack Wright, who thenceforth gave the animal a
wide berth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as Knollys came out of the laboratory,
Will Allison told him his suspicions in regard to
Wright, and urged him to put his energies upon
the Latin. But Knollys was always slow to believe
that a comrade could be guilty of treachery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think Wright is really such a bad
lot, old man,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;only his manner is unfortunate,
and he isn&rsquo;t popular.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just three days later appeared on the notice-board
the announcement that B. Knollys and J. S.
Wright were competitors for the Junior Latin
scholarship! The examination was to take place
on the following morning. Bert Knollys was hurt
and indignant; his friends were furious; and
Wright looked craftily triumphant over the prospect
of so neatly getting ahead of a rival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knollys was by no means prepared for such a
contest as he knew Wright was capable of giving
him; but his anger nerved him to the utmost effort.
Returning in hot haste to his home in the outskirts
of the town, he shut himself into his little study.
All through the afternoon he toiled mightily over
book and lexicon. About tea time he took a short
walk, and then settled down for a night of solid
&ldquo;grind.&rdquo; He was bound that he would win if it
was in him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toward two o&rsquo;clock, however, eyes and brain
alike grew dim, and the meanings began to mix
<span class="pb" id="Page_265">265</span>
themselves most vexatiously. He sprang up,
snatched his cap, let himself out of the house
noiselessly, and set forth to wake his wits by a
brisk run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the sake of the freer air he took a path
traversing the hilltop toward the college. The
path ran through the open pastures, and reached
at length a rocky ridge just back of the cottage of
Doctor Adams, the professor of classics. Here
Jack Wright was boarding. As Knollys swung
past along the ridge he glanced downward to the
professor&rsquo;s study window; and as he did so a light
appeared therein. He halted instinctively; and
the next moment his lip was curling with astonished
contempt as he saw Jack Wright seat himself
before the study table, and stealthily search
the drawers. The top of the ridge was so near the
window that Knollys, where he leaned against
the fence, could see all that went on, as if he had
been in the room. At last, after going through
almost every drawer with frequent guilty, listening
pauses, Wright found what he wanted, an
examination paper! After making a hurried copy
of it, he returned it to its place; and then, with
his lamp turned very low, he stole out of the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bert Knollys&rsquo;s first thought was to go at once
to Doctor Adams, lay his complaint, and have
Wright&rsquo;s room searched before he could have time
to destroy the stolen copy. Then it occurred to
<span class="pb" id="Page_266">266</span>
him that this would lead inevitably to Wright&rsquo;s
expulsion, and not improbably to his ruin. He
therefore dismissed the idea. He hastened back
home; tried to study, but found the effort vain;
went to bed, and fell asleep without having arrived
at any solution of the problem. In the morning
he was equally undecided. Perhaps his best course
would have been to go to the professor, declare a
suspicion that the paper had been tampered with,
and ask that a new paper be set. But he failed to
think of this way out of the difficulty; and, at last,
tired of worrying over it, he made up his mind to
do nothing. He went in to the examination,
wrote an unusually good paper, and came out feeling
that there was yet a chance for him in spite of
Wright&rsquo;s previous knowledge of the questions.
But on the day following was posted the announcement
that Wright was the winner by a
lead of three marks on the average for the four
examinations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The affair was a grievous disappointment to
Bert Knollys, and meant the upsetting of all his
plans for the summer. He had counted on the
scholarship money to enable him to take a long
vacation trip with Will Allison. This scheme he
had now to abandon; and Allison could not refrain
from reproaching him for his misplaced confidence
in Jack Wright. Furthermore, he was accused of
petty jealousy by many students outside of his
own class; and his popularity, undermined by
<span class="pb" id="Page_267">267</span>
Wright&rsquo;s skilful insinuations, rapidly dwindled
away. Smarting under the injustice, and seeing
no satisfactory way to remove the misunderstanding,
Knollys grew moody and depressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The days slipped by quickly, and Commencement
was close at hand. One warm afternoon, a
number of the students were in the baseball field,
where a practice match was in progress. The
college Nine was strenuously preparing for the
great Commencement Day match. Knollys, Allison,
Jones, and a few others, were lying under the
fence on the farther side of the field, while most
of the spectators were grouped as close as possible
to the players. Jack Wright was at the bat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly in the gate of the college barnyard,
above the ball-field, appeared Bran, the dog. The
hair lifted along his back-bone and on his neck,
and a light froth showed about his half-bared
teeth. He was a sinister and menacing figure as
he stood there, a strange trouble in his wild, red
eyes. After glaring uneasily from side to side for
several minutes, he gave utterance to a yelping
snarl, and darted down the hillside toward the
field. The group under the fence observed him
at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the dog?&rsquo; exclaimed
Jones, in a tone of apprehension; and &lsquo;Look
at Bran!&rsquo; shouted some one else. The pitcher
stopped in the very act of delivering the ball, and
every eye went in the one direction. The dread
<span class="pb" id="Page_268">268</span>
truth was evident at once. On all sides arose the
appalling cry, &lsquo;He&rsquo;s mad! Mad dog! Mad dog!&rsquo;
and players and spectators scattered in sickening
panic. As it were in the twinkling of an eye,
the field was empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no! It was not quite empty! Turning in
wild terror, and starting to run as he turned, Jack
Wright tripped, fell, and snapped his ankle. He
got up, and saw himself alone in the wide, sunny
field. The dog had just entered the gate, and was
making straight for him with foaming, snapping
jaws. He strove to flee, but the shattered ankle
gave way beneath him; and, with a piercing cry of
horror, he dropped in a heap, burying his face in
his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knollys, like all the rest, had sprung over the
fence at the first alarm; but at that despairing cry
he sprang back again. There was no hesitation,
no waiting to see what the others would do.
Swift as a deer he sped out across the shining and
deadly expanse. As he ran, he stooped to snatch
up a bat which lay in his path. It was a question
which would win in the awful race; and the crowd
of fugitives, checking their flight, watched in
spellbound silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dog arrived first, but only by a foot or
two. As it sprang at Wright&rsquo;s prostrate body
Knollys reached out with a fierce lunge, and
caught it between the jaws with the end of the
bat. Biting madly at the wood, the animal rose
<span class="pb" id="Page_269">269</span>
on its hind legs, and in a flash Knollys had both
hands clenched in a grip of steel about its throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a few seconds the struggle was a desperate
one. The animal&rsquo;s strength was great, and
Knollys had all he could do to hold him at arm&rsquo;s
length. Then Will Allison arrived, panting, and
conscience-stricken for his tardiness. He was followed
by two or three others who had broken the
spell of their panic. A couple of well-directed
blows from the bat in Allison&rsquo;s hands stunned the
dog, and it was then speedily despatched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breathing somewhat quickly, but otherwise
quite cool, Knollys looked down upon Jack
Wright&rsquo;s gastly face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Glad I was in time, Wright!&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bert,&rsquo; cried Wright, in a shaking voice, &lsquo;<i>you</i>
won that scholarship! I just cribbed the whole
paper!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To thank his rescuer, he felt, was not within
the power of words; but reparation was in part
possible, and his one thought was to make it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We won&rsquo;t talk of that now,&rsquo; answered Knollys.
&lsquo;I know all about it, Jack! I saw the whole
thing; and we just won&rsquo;t say anything more about
it, old fellow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Wright had fainted from the pain and the
shock, and did not hear the forgiveness in Bert&rsquo;s
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next day a letter went from Wright&rsquo;s
sick-bed to the president of the college. Wright
<span class="pb" id="Page_270">270</span>
wanted to tell everything; but on Bert&rsquo;s advice he
merely confessed that he had cribbed, without saying
how, and resigned his claim to the scholarship.
At Commencement, therefore, it was announced
by the president that the Latin scholarship had
been won by B. Knollys. Many conflicting rumors,
of course, went abroad among the students; but
to no one except Will Allison was the whole truth
told. As for Wright, a new point of view seemed
all at once to have opened before his eyes. The
loftier standard which he now learned to set himself,
he adhered to throughout the rest of his
course, and then carried forth with him into what
have proved very creditable and successful relations
with the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Queerman has grown didactic,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;That
is surely not the tone for a canoe trip. Ranolf,
it&rsquo;s your turn to take the platform. Let us have
something that is simple, unmedicated adventure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you a bicycle story,&rdquo; said Ranolf;
&ldquo;an unromantic tale of a romantic land. It is
all about a bull and a bicycle in the land of
Evangeline.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>A BULL AND A BICYCLE.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;It was in the autumn of 1889, while the old,
high wheels were still in use, that I rode through
the Evangeline land with a fellow-wheelman from
Halifax. We rolled lazily along a well-kept road,
<span class="pb" id="Page_271">271</span>
and sang the praises of Nova Scotia&rsquo;s scenery and
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahead of us, across a wide, flashing water, the
storied expanse of Minas, towered the blue-black
bastion of Cape Blomidon, capped with rolling
vapors. To our left, and behind us, rose fair,
rounded hills, some thickly wooded, others with
orchards and meadows on their slopes; while to
our right lay far unrolled those rich diked lands
which the vanished Acadian farmers of old won
back from the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though another race now held these lovely
regions, we felt that the landscape, through whatever
vicissitudes, must lie changelessly under the
spell of one enchantment,&mdash;the touch of the well-loved
poet. We felt that something more than
mere beauty of scene, however wonderful, was
needed to explain the exalted mood which had
taken possession of two hungry wheelmen like
ourselves; and we acknowledged that additional
something in the romance of history and song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently we came to a stretch of road which
had been treated to a generous top-dressing of
loose sand. Such ignorance of the principles of
good road-making soon brought us down both
from our lofty mood and from our laboring
wheels. We trudged toilsomely for nearly half
a mile, saying unkind things now of the Nova
Scotian road-makers, and quite forgetting the
melodious sorrows of the Acadian exiles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we came to the village of Avonport,
and were much solaced by the sight of the village
inn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the porch of the unpretentious hostelry we
found a fellow &rsquo;cycler in a sorely battered condition.
Several strips of court-plaster, black and
pink, distributed artistically about his forehead,
nose, and chin, gave a mightily grotesque appearance
to his otherwise melancholy countenance.
One of his stockings was rolled down about his
ankle, and he was busy applying arnica to a badly
bruised shin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Against the bench on which he was sitting
leaned a bicycle which looked as if it had been
in collision with an earthquake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor fellow&rsquo;s woe-begone countenance
brightened up as we entered, and we made ourselves
acquainted. He was a solitary tourist from
Eastport, Me., and a principal in the important
case of Bull <i>versus</i> Bicycle, which had just been
decided very much in favor of Bull. We dined
together, and as our appetites diminished our curiosity
increased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently Caldwell, as the woe-begone &rsquo;cyclist
called himself, detailed to us his misadventure,
as follows;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t more than an hour before you fellows
came that I got here myself. I was in a nice
mess, I can tell you. But plenty of cold water
and Mrs. Brigg&rsquo;s arnica and court-plaster have
<span class="pb" id="Page_273">273</span>
pulled me together a lot. I only hope we can do
as much after dinner for that poor old wheel of
mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This morning I had a fine trip pretty nearly
all the way from Windsor. Splendid weather,
wasn&rsquo;t it; and a good hard road most of the way,
eh? You remember that long, smooth hill about
two miles back from here, and the road that
crosses it at the foot, nearly at right angles?
Well, as I came coasting down that hill, happy
as a clam, my feet over the handles, I almost ran
into a party of men, with ropes and a gun, moving
along that cross-road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I stopped for a little talk with them, and
asked what they were up to. It appeared that a
very dangerous bull had got loose from a farm up
the river, and had taken to the road. They were
afraid it would gore somebody before they could
recapture it. I asked them if they knew which
way it had gone; and they told me the &ldquo;critter&rdquo;
was sure to make right for the dike lands, where
it used to pasture in its earlier and more amiable
days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That cross-road was the way to the dikes, and
they pursued it confidently. I took it into my
head that it would be a lark to go along with
them, and see the capture of the obstreperous
animal; but the men, who were intelligent fellows
and knew what they were talking about, told
me I should find the road too heavy and rough
<span class="pb" id="Page_274">274</span>
for my wheel. Rather reluctantly I bade them
good-morning and continued my journey by the
highway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, as a fact, that bull had no notion of
going to the dikes. He had turned off the cross-road,
and sauntered along the highway, just where
he could get most fun, and see the most of life.
But I&rsquo;ll venture to say he hadn&rsquo;t counted on
meeting a bicycle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I hadn&rsquo;t gone more than half a mile, or perhaps
less, when a little distance ahead of me
I noticed some cattle feeding by the roadside. I
thought nothing of that, of course; but presently
one of the cattle&mdash;a tremendous animal, almost
pure white&mdash;stepped into the middle of the road
and began to paw the mud. Certain anxious
questionings arose within me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then the animal put his great head to the
earth, and uttered a mighty bellow. With much
perturbation of spirit I concluded that the angry
bull had not betaken himself to the dikes after
all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I felt very bitter toward those men for this
mistake, and for not having suffered me to go
along with them on their futile errand. They
wanted the bull, and wouldn&rsquo;t find him. I, on
the other hand, had found him, and I didn&rsquo;t want
him at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I checked my course, pedalling very slowly,
uncertain what to do. The bull stood watching
<span class="pb" id="Page_275">275</span>
me. If I turned and made tracks he would catch
me on the hill or on the soft cross-road. If I took
to the woods there was little to gain, for there
were no fences behind which to take refuge; and
if I should climb a tree I knew the beast would
demolish my wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Straight ahead, however, as far as I could
see, the road was level and good; and in the distance
I saw farms and fences. I decided to keep
right on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The road along there is wide and hard, as
you know, and bordered with a deep ditch. I
put on good speed; and the bull, as he saw me
approaching, looked a little puzzled. He took
the wheel and me, I presume, for some unheard
of monster. I guessed his meditations, and concluded
he was getting frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But there I was mistaken. He was only
getting in a rage. He suddenly concluded that
it was his mission to rid the world of monsters;
and with a roar he charged down to meet me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;for a trick! and then a
race, in which I&rsquo;ll show a pretty speedy pair of
heels!&rdquo; I rode straight at the bull, who must
have had strange misgivings, though he never
flinched. At the last possible moment I swerved
sharply aside, and swept past the baffled animal
in a fine triumphant curve. Before he could stop
himself and turn I was away down the road at
a pace that I knew would try his mettle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But the brute had a most pernicious energy.
He came thundering and pounding along my
tracks at a rate that kept me quite busy. I
stayed ahead easily enough, but I did not do
much more than that for fear of getting winded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s where I made the mistake, I think.
I ought to have done my utmost, in order to discourage
and distance my pursuer. I didn&rsquo;t allow
for contingencies ahead, but just pedalled along
gayly and enjoyed the situation. Of course I kept
a sharp lookout, in order that I shouldn&rsquo;t take
a header over a stone; but I felt myself master
of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At last, and in an evil hour, I came to where
they had been mending the road with all that
abominable sand. Let us pass over my feelings
at this spot. They were indescribable. My wheel
almost came to a standstill. Then I called up
fresh energies, and bent forward and strained to
the task. I went ahead, but it was like wading
through a feather-bed; and the bull began to
draw nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A little in front the fences began. The first
was a high board fence, with a gate in it, and a
hay-road leading by a rough bridge into the highway.
My whole effort now was to make that gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The perspiration was rolling down my face,
half-blinding me. My mighty pursuer was getting
closer and closer; and I was feeling pretty
well pumped. It was as much as a bargain which
<span class="pb" id="Page_277">277</span>
would win the race. I dared not look behind, but
my anxious ears kept me all too well informed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I reached the bridge and darted across it.
Immediately I heard my pursuer&rsquo;s feet upon it.
I had no time to dismount. I rode straight at the
gate, ran upon it, and shot over it head-first in a
magnificent header, landing in a heap of stones
and brambles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In a glow of triumph, which at first prevented
me feeling my wounds, I picked myself up, and
beheld the furious beast in the act of trying to
gore my unoffending bicycle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At first he had stopped in consternation, naturally
amazed at seeing the monster divided into
two parts. The portion which had shot over the
gate he perceived to be very like a man; but
the other part remained all the more mysterious.
Presently he plunged his horns tentatively into
the big wheel; whereupon my brave bicycle
reared and struck him in the eye with a handle,
and set the little wheel crawling up his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At this the bull was astonished and alarmed&mdash;so
much so that he backed off a little way.
Then, seeing that the bicycle lay motionless on
the ground, he charged upon it again, maltreating
it shamefully, and tossing it up on his horns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This was too much for me. I ran up, reached
over the gate, and laid hold of my precious wheel.
By strange good fortune I succeeded in detaching
it from the brute&rsquo;s horns and hauling it over the
<span class="pb" id="Page_278">278</span>
gate. Then I pelted the animal with sticks and
stones till he got disgusted and moved away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As soon as he was safely off the scene I
opened the gate and limped sorrowfully down to
this place, dragging my wheel by my side. Do
you think we can do anything with it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The first thing necessary,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;is to have
an examination, and make a diagnosis of its injuries.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This we forthwith proceeded to do, and found
the matter pretty serious. After spending an
hour in tinkering at the machine we had to give
up the job. Then we set forth on a visit to the
village blacksmith who, after being regaled with
a full account of Caldwell&rsquo;s misadventure, addressed
himself to his task with vast good-will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a skilful man, and before nightfall
the wheel was in better travelling shape than its
unlucky owner. But Caldwell was good stuff,
and of a merry heart; so that when, on the following
day, he became our travelling companion, we
found that his scars and his lugubrious countenance
only heightened the effect of his good-fellowship.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that after a cheerful narrative
like Ranolf&rsquo;s you can stand a somewhat
bloody one from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, O. M.,&rdquo; answered Queerman; &ldquo;pile
on as much gore as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t expect too much,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only
another wolf story. The name thereof is&mdash;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;THE DEN OF THE GRAY WOLF.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Not long ago I was doing the Tobique with
Joe Maxim, an old hunter whom I think none
of you have met. We were dropping smoothly
down with the current, approaching the Narrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maxim was a curious and interesting character.
Of good old Colonial stock, and equipped
in youth with an excellent education, he had
found himself, in early manhood, at odds with
society and the requirements of civilized life.
Perhaps through some remote ancestor there had
crept into his veins a streak of Indian or other
wandering blood. At any rate, the wilderness
had drawn him with a spell that overcame all
counter attractions. He drifted to the remotest
backwoods, and there devoted himself to hunting
and trapping. Never entering the settlements except
to purchase supplies or sell his furs, he had
spent the best years of his life in an almost unbroken
solitude. Yet the few sportsmen who
penetrated to his haunts and sought his skilful
services found that seclusion had failed to make
him morose. He was kindly, and not uncompanionable;
and though in appearance one of the
roughest of his adopted class, he preserved to
a marked degree the speech and accent of his
earlier days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You were speaking just now,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;of
the wolves coming back to New Brunswick.
Well, they&rsquo;re here, off and on, most of the time,
I reckon. It was not far from here that I had
a scrimmage with them about twenty years back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this point a murmurous roaring began to
make itself heard on the still air; and before I
could ask any more questions about the wolves,
Maxim exclaimed,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We can&rsquo;t go through the &ldquo;Narrows&rdquo; to-night.
Not light enough with this head of water.
Better camp right here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Agreed!&rsquo; said I; and we slid gently up
along side of a projecting log. Presently we had
the tent pitched on a bit of dry, soft sward that
sloped ever so little toward the waterside. Behind
the tent was a thicket of spruce that sheltered
us from the night wind; and in front
laughed softly the river, as it hurried along its
shining trail beneath the full moon, to bury itself
in the chasms of the dark hill-range which separated
it from its sovereign, the wide St. John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After supper, when the camp-fire was blazing
cheerfully, Maxim told me about the wolves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he in a reminiscent tone, &lsquo;it was
in those hills yonder, very near the Narrows, I
struck the wolves. I knew there were a good
many of them &rsquo;round that winter, as I&rsquo;d come
across lots of their tracks. There was a bounty
then of fifteen dollars on a wolf&rsquo;s snout,&mdash;that
<span class="pb" id="Page_281">281</span>
was twenty years ago,&mdash;and I was keeping my
eyes pretty well peeled. My lookout was all in
vain, however, till along one afternoon I caught
sight of one of the skulking vermin dodging behind
some bushes, not far from here, but on the
other side of the river. It was only a snap shot
I got at the beast, but I wounded it; and you&rsquo;d
better believe I lost no time following up the
trail. By the way he bled, I could see that he
was hard hit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He led me away up, nigh the top of the
mountain, then took a sharp turn to the river;
and pretty soon I came out onto a little level
place, a sort of high platform, in front of a big,
bare slope of rock. In the foot of that rock there
was a hole, just about big enough for a man to
crawl into on his hands and knees, and into that
hole led the trail of my wolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Got him, fast enough!&rdquo; said I to myself;
&ldquo;but how to get at him&mdash;there&rsquo;s the rub!&rdquo; As I
stood there considering, <i>another</i> wolf slid by me,
like a long, gray shadow, and sneaked into the
den. Without putting the gun to my shoulder,
I gave him a shot, which fetched him in the hindquarters
just as he disappeared. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good
for thirty dollars,&rdquo; said I to myself, loading up
again, and hoping some more would come along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They didn&rsquo;t come; so pretty soon I gave them
up, and went and examined the hole. I could see
that it narrowed down rapidly, and I hardly knew
<span class="pb" id="Page_282">282</span>
what to do. I wanted that thirty dollars; but I
didn&rsquo;t want to crawl into that little dark hole
after it, with maybe a couple of yet lively wolves
waiting at the other end to receive me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you leave them there and go
back for them next day? By that time, if they
were really hard-hit, you&rsquo;d have found them dead
enough!&rsquo; was my comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There wouldn&rsquo;t have been much of them
left for me by the morrow,&rsquo; said Maxim. &lsquo;I knew
well enough the other wolves would scent the
blood and come along, and help themselves to
snouts and all in the night. So by and by I
made up my mind to crawl in and risk it. Standing
my gun up against the rock, and taking my
knife in my right hand, I started in!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ugh!&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;it makes me shiver to think
of it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It <i>was</i> nasty,&rsquo; assented Maxim; &lsquo;but then, I
counted on one of the vermin, at least, being
dead; and I didn&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;d be much fight
left in the other. But that hole narrowed down
mighty sudden, and the first thing I knew, I had
to crawl flat on my stomach to get along at all;
and presently I found it tight squeezing even
that way. Of course I held my right hand, with
the knife in it, well to the front, ready to protect
my head and face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just as the hole got so tight for me that I
was about concluding to give up the job, I heard
<span class="pb" id="Page_283">283</span>
a terrific snarl right in my ear, and a wolf jumped
onto me. His fangs got me right in the jaw,&mdash;you
can see the scars here now,&mdash;and I thought
I was about fixed. But I slashed out desperately
with my big knife, and caught my assailant somewhere
with a deadly thrust. He yelped, and
sprang out of the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I felt the blood streaming over my face, and
knew I was badly bitten. I&rsquo;d had enough of that
enterprise; but when I tried to back out the way
I had come, I found I couldn&rsquo;t work it. When it
dawned upon me that I was stuck in that trap, a
cold sweat broke out all over me. I <i>was</i> stuck,
and no mistake. Then I wriggled a little farther
in; and, at this, the wolf was onto me again.
This time my face escaped, and his fangs went
into my shoulder; but the next moment my knife-edge
found his throat, and down he came in a
heap. Then I lay still a bit, to get my breath and
consider the situation. The one thing clear was,
that I had got myself into a tight place, and I
began to wriggle for all I was worth in order to
get out of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;After twisting and tugging and straining for
perhaps ten solid minutes, I was forced to acknowledge
to myself that I had not gained one
inch. Then I made up my mind that my only
hope lay in squeezing myself all the way in.
Once inside the cave, I thought, it would be comparatively
easy work to wriggle out head-first.
<span class="pb" id="Page_284">284</span>
In this direction I gained a few inches,&mdash;perhaps
a foot, or more; and by this time I felt so exhausted
that I wanted to lie still and take a sleep,
which, I knew, of course, would be madness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Intending to rest but a moment, I must,
nevertheless, have fallen into a doze. How long
I lay thus, I don&rsquo;t know; but it must have been
getting well along past sundown when I was
awakened by a sound that brought my heart into
my throat and made every hair stand on end.
It was the howl of a wolf outside!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I interrupted the story at this point with an
involuntary &lsquo;Ah&mdash;h&mdash;h!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Maxim, acknowledging my sympathy,
&lsquo;I could <i>face</i> any number of the vermin,
and not lose hold of myself; but the idea of them
coming along <i>behind</i>, and eating me gradually,
feet first, was too much. I think that for a
minute or two I must have been clean crazy. At
any rate, I found strength enough, in that minute
or two, to force my way right on, and into
the cave, without knowing how I did it. And
I found afterwards that the struggle had peeled
off, not only most of my clothes, but lots of the
flesh on my hips and shoulders as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As soon as I realized that I was inside the
den, I felt round for the two dead wolves, and
stuffed them head-first into the hole I had just
come through. They filled it pretty snugly; and
then I seated myself on their hind legs to hold
them solid, and hunted for a match.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In the rags of my clothes I had a pocket left,
and fortunately there were some matches in it.
Lighting one, I perceived in the sudden flare that
I was in a little cave, about four feet high, and
maybe seven or eight feet square. The floor of it
was dry sand, and there were bones lying about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Presently, in the tunnel behind me, sounded
a snarl that seemed to come right against my
backbone, and I jumped about a foot. Then I
grabbed hold of the dead wolves, and hung onto
them for all I was worth, for I could feel something
dragging at one of them. You see, my experience
in the hole had shaken my nerves pretty
badly. If I&rsquo;d been just myself, I should have
cleared the way, and let my assailants in, killing
them one by one, with my knife, as they crawled
through. As it was, however, I gave a yell that
scared the brute in the tunnel, so that he backed
out in a hurry, and then I heard two or three
of them howling outside. But it encouraged me
a good deal to see what an effect my voice produced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pretty soon one of the wolves crept back,
sniffing, sniffing, into the hole; and as soon as
he discovered that it was only dead wolves that
were stopping the way, he began to gnaw. It was
a sickening sound he made, gnawing that way.
After standing it as long as I could, I put my
face down between the bodies, and gave another
yell. How it echoed in that little place! and
<span class="pb" id="Page_286">286</span>
how quick that wolf backed out again! For all
the misery and anxiety I was in, I couldn&rsquo;t help
laughing to myself there in the dark, wondering
what the brute would think it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I tried this game on half a dozen times very
successfully; but after that the wolves ceased to
mind it. One would come and gnaw for a while,
then another would give him a nip in the rear,
squeeze past, and take his place. I soon began to
fear my unique barricade would be all eaten away
before morning, and I cast about in my mind for
some other means of diverting the hungry animals&rsquo;
attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At length a brilliant idea struck me. I lit
a match, and thrust it into the hole right under
the cannibals&rsquo; noses. That gave them a big surprise,
I can tell you. They backed out in a great
hurry, and sniffed about and howled a good deal
before they ventured in again. As long as those
matches held out, I had no trouble; and the
wolves just kept howling outside the hole, not
daring to come in after their victuals while there
were such mysterious goings-on within the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By and by, however, like all good things, the
matches came to an end. Then presently in came
the wolves, and soon they were gnawing away
harder than ever. I was thinking that before
long I would have to fight it out with the crowd
after all, and then it occurred to me that I
might as well begin right off. Lying flat down,
<span class="pb" id="Page_287">287</span>
I thrust my right hand, with the knife in it, blade
up, as far as I could reach out into the hole, but
underneath the dead wolves. Then I gave two or
three tremendous sweeping slashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One of the brutes must have caught it pretty
stiff. He yelped and snarled hideously, and got
outside for all he was worth. Then for a minute
or two the whole lot howled and yelped in chorus.
They must have been discussing the various mysteries
of the cave, and concluded that these were
too dangerous to be explored any further; for
presently all was silent, and by an occasional
yelp in the distance, I knew that the animals had
betaken themselves elsewhere. I know it was a
crazy thing to do; but just as soon as I&rsquo;d made up
my mind the wolves were gone, I dropped to sleep
right across the entrance of the den.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When I awoke I was so still and my wounds
pained so, that I could hardly move. But I knew
I had to brace up, and get out of that before
another night should come. I pulled away the
bodies, and saw it was broad daylight. I took my
knife, and chipped away for a long while at the
walls and roof of the tunnel, finding the rock very
soft and crumbly. Then I crawled out, with pain
and difficulty, and pointed straight for the settlements,
where I arrived more dead than alive. But
I managed to lug along with me what there was
left of those wolf-snouts, together with the tails;
and I got the thirty dollars after all.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<p>&ldquo;As Maxim finished his story, the roar of the
Narrows, long unheeded, fell again upon my ear
with a distinctness almost startling, and a loon
cried mockingly from a hidden lakelet. Maxim
rose, and replenished the sinking fire. Then we
rolled ourselves into our blankets, as I propose
that we all do now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed!&rdquo; cried several voices at once; and
very soon the camp on the Toledi was sunk in
slumber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE TOLEDI AND TEMISCOUATA.</span></h2>
<p>None of us awoke next morning till the sun
was high and the dew all gone in the open places
about the camp. The air was sweet with wild
perfumes, and alive with birds and butterflies. It
was near noon by the time we found ourselves
afloat on the Toledi River. This is a larger
stream than the Squatook, and much more violent.
The &ldquo;Toledi Falls&rdquo; are less than half a mile from
the lake, and most travellers &ldquo;portage&rdquo; around
them rather than risk the difficult passage. Indeed,
the mighty, plunging swells, the succession
of leaps, the roar and tumult between those rocky
walls, render the passage by no means enticing
when looked at in cold blood. But we knew the
channels, and were resolved to &ldquo;run it.&rdquo; It is no
use attempting to tell just how we did it. I only
know we all yelled with fierce delight as we
darted into the gorge, and I imagine our eyes
stuck out. Our muscles were like steel, and we
tingled to the finger-tips. Then came a few wild
moments when every man did his level best without
knowing exactly how; for the white surges
clashed deafeningly about us, and with cheers
<span class="pb" id="Page_290">290</span>
we swept into the big eddy below the falls&mdash;drenched,
but safe. What cared we for a wetting
in that clear sunshine? The passion of travel
was on us, and we could not stay to fish. All
the rest of the run down to Temiscouata is like a
dream to me. Few rocks, few shoals, a straight
channel, and always that tearing current. At
four in the afternoon a last mad rapid hurled us
out into the wide expanse of Temiscouata. There
was a sharp wind on the lake, which is thirty
miles long, and at this point about three miles
wide. In the heavy seas, with our deep-laden
canoes, we had a rough and really perilous passage;
and it was not far from six o&rsquo;clock when
we reached the other shore. There, near the outskirts
of the little village of D&eacute;tour du Lac, we
pitched tent for the night.</p>
<p>After supper we took a run through the village,
and had a chat with some of the habitans. We
procured, moreover, some native Madawaska tobacco&mdash;which
we smoked once, and never smoked
again.</p>
<p>Around the fire that night we felt a sense of
depression because our trip was drawing to an
end. At last Magnus cried,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shake off this gloom, boys. A story, Stranion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; here&rsquo;s something light and bright,&rdquo;
answered Stranion promptly. &ldquo;Let us call it&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">291</div>
<h3>&lsquo;CHOPPING HIM DOWN.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing that so cheers the heart of
the lumberman as to play a practical joke on one
whom he calls a &lsquo;greenhorn,&rsquo; or, in other words,
any one unused to the strange ways and flavor of
the lumber-camps. As may be imagined, the practical
jokes in vogue in such rough company are
not remarkable for gentleness. One of the harshest
and most dangerous, as well as most admired,
is that known as &lsquo;chopping him down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This means, in a word, that the unsophisticated
stranger in the camp is invited to climb a
tall tree to take observations or enjoy a remarkable
view. No sooner has he reached the top,
than a couple of vigorous axemen attack the tree
at its base, while the terrified stranger makes
fierce haste to descend from his too lofty situation.
Long before he can reach the ground the
tree begins to topple. The men shout to him to
get on the upper side, which he does with appalled
alacrity; and with a mighty swish and
crash down comes the tree. As a general rule,
the heavy branches so break the shock that the
victim, to his intense astonishment, finds himself
uninjured; though frequently he is frightened out
of a year&rsquo;s growth. There are cases on record,
however, where men have been crippled for
life in this outrageous play; and in some cases
the &lsquo;boss&rsquo; of the camp forbids it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">292</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it is not only the greenhorn who is subject
to this discipline of chopping down. Even
veterans sometimes like to climb a tree and take
a view beyond the forest; and sometimes, on a
holiday or a Sunday, some contemplative woodsman
will take refuge in a tree-top to think of his
sweetheart, or else to eat a sheet of stolen gingerbread.
If his retreat be discovered by his
comrades, he is promptly chopped down with inextinguishable
jeers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have mentioned stolen gingerbread. This
bread is a favorite delicacy in the camps; and the
cook who can make really good gingerbread is
prized indeed. It is made in wide, thin, tough
sheets; and while it is being served to the hands,
some fellow occasionally succeeds in &lsquo;hooking&rsquo; a
whole sheet while the cook&rsquo;s back is toward him.
But in that same instant every man&rsquo;s hand is
turned against him. He darts into the woods,
devouring huge mouthfuls as he runs. If he is
very swift of foot he may escape, eat his spoils
in retirement, and stroll back, an hour later, with
a conscious air of triumph. More often he has to
take to a tree. Instantly all hands rush to chop
him down. He climbs no higher than is necessary,
perches himself on a stout limb, and eats at
his gingerbread for dear life. He knows just what
position to take for safety; and often, ere the tree
comes down, there is little gingerbread left to
reward its captors. The meagre remnant is usually
<span class="pb" id="Page_293">293</span>
handed over with an admirable submissiveness,
if it is not dropped in the fall, and annihilated
in the snow and <i>d&eacute;bris</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At one time I knew a lumberman who succeeded
in hiding his stolen gingerbread in his
long boot-legs, and slept with the boots under his
head for security. The camp was on the banks
of a lake. The time of the capture of the gingerbread
was a Saturday night in spring. Next
morning the spoiler took possession of the one
&lsquo;bateau&rsquo; belonging to the camp, rowed out into
the lake beyond the reach of stones and snowballs,
and then calmly fished the gingerbread out
of his boots. Sitting at ease in the bateau, he
devoured his dainty with the utmost deliberation,
while his chagrined comrades could only guy him
from the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For myself, I was chopped down once, and
once only. It happened in this way. In the midwinter
of 1879 I had occasion to visit the chief
camp on the Little Madawaska. Coming from
the city, and to a camp where I was a stranger to
all the men, I was not unnaturally regarded as
a pronounced specimen of the greenhorn. I took
no pains to tell any one what the boss already
well knew; that is, that I had been a frequenter
of the camps from my boyhood. Many and many
a neat trap was laid for my apparently &lsquo;tender&rsquo;
feet, but I avoided them all as if by accident. As
for climbing a tree, I always laughed at the idea
<span class="pb" id="Page_294">294</span>
when it was proposed to me. I always suggested
that it might spoil my clothes. Before long the
men, by putting little things together, came to the
conclusion that I was an old stager; and, rather
sheepishly, they gave over their attempts to entrap
me. Then I graciously waved my hand, as
it were, and was frankly received as a veteran,
cleared from every suspicion of being green.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last the day came when I <i>did</i> wish to
climb a tree. The camp was on a high plateau,
and not far off towered a magnificent pine-tree,
growing out of the summit of a knoll in such a
way as to command all the surrounding country.
Its branches were phenomenally thick; its girth
of trunk was magnificent. And this tree I resolved
one day to climb, in order to get a clear
idea of the lay of the land. Of course I strolled
off surreptitiously, and, as I thought, unwatched.
But there I was much mistaken. No sooner was
I two-thirds of the way up the tree than, with
shouts of laughter, the lumbermen rushed out of
the surrounding cover, and proceeded to chop me
down. The chance was too good for them to lose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I concealed my annoyance, and made no attempt
to descend. On the contrary, I thanked
them for the little attention, and climbed a few
feet farther up, to secure a position which I saw
would be a safe one for me when the tree should
fall. As I did so, I perceived, with a gasp and a
tremor, that I was not alone in the tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">295</div>
<p>&ldquo;There, not ten feet above me, stretched at full
length along a large branch, was a huge panther,
glaring with rage and terror. From the men below
his form was quite concealed. Glancing restlessly
from me to my pursuers, the brute seemed
uncertain just what to do. As I carefully refrained
from climbing any farther up, and tried
to assume an air of not having observed him, he
apparently concluded that I was not his worst
enemy. In fact, I dare say he understood what
was going on, and realized that he and I were
fellow-sufferers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I laughed softly to myself as I thought how my
tormentors would be taken aback when that panther
should come down among them. I decided
that, considering their numbers, there would be at
least no more danger for them than that to which
they were exposing me in their reckless fooling.
And, already influenced by that touch of nature
which makes us so wondrous kind, I began to
hope that the panther would succeed in escaping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trunk of the pine was so thick that I
might almost have reached the ground before the
choppers could cut it through. At last it gave a
mighty shudder and sagged to one side. I balanced
myself nimbly on the upper side, steadying
myself by a convenient branch. The great mass
of foliage, presenting a wide surface to the air,
made the fall a comparatively slow one; but the
tremendous sweep of the draught upward, as the
<span class="pb" id="Page_296">296</span>
tree-top described its gigantic arc, gave me a sickening
sensation. Then came the final dull and
thunderous crash, and in an instant I found myself
standing in my place, jarred but unhurt, with the
snow threshed up all about me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next instant there was another roar, or
rather a sort of screaming yell, overwhelming the
riotous laughter of the woodsmen; and out of
the confusion of pine-boughs shot the tawny form
of the panther in a whirlwind of fury. One of
the choppers was in his path, and was bowled
over like a clumsy ninepin. The next bound
brought the beast onto the backs of a yoke
of oxen, and his cruel claws severely scratched
their necks. As the poor animals bellowed and fell
on their knees, the panther paused, with some
idea, apparently, of fighting the whole assembled
party. But as the men, recovered from their first
amazement, rushed with their axes to the rescue
of the oxen, the panther saw that the odds were
all against him. He turned half round, and
greeted his enemies with one terrific and strident
snarl, then bounded off into the forest at a pace
which made it idle to pursue him. The owner of
the oxen hurled an axe after him, but the missile
flew wide of its mark.</p>
<p>As the excitement subsided, and I saw that the
chopper who had been knocked over was none the
worse for his tumble, I chaffed my tormentors unmercifully.
For their part they had no answer
<span class="pb" id="Page_297">297</span>
ready. They seemed almost to think that I had
conjured up the panther for the occasion. I
thanked them most fervently for coming to my
rescue with such whole-hearted good-will, and
promised them that if ever again I got into a tree
with a panther I would send for them at once.
Then I set myself to doctoring the unfortunate
oxen, whose lacerated necks and shoulders we
soon mended up with impromptu plasters. And
the owner of the oxen gratefully vowed to me,
&lsquo;If ever I see any of the chaps a-laying for ye
agin, an&rsquo; any of my critters is around, I&rsquo;ll tip ye
the wink, shore!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Here goes for another lumberman&rsquo;s yarn,&rdquo;
began Sam, when Stranion ceased. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s brief,
so bear with it.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;A RUDE AWAKENING.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;In the fir-woods of the Upper Bartibogue the
snow was softening rapidly. The spring thaws
had come on several weeks earlier than they were
expected, consequently a great quantity of logs
lay in the woods waiting to be hauled to the
landing. The hands at Bober&rsquo;s Camp were working
with feverish energy, in the effort to get all
their logs out before the snow roads should go
utterly to pieces. Old Paul Bober, the boss of the
camp, had sent out to all the surrounding settlements
for extra teams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">298</div>
<p>&ldquo;The first result of his efforts was a team of
wild young steers, which seemed hardly more than
half-broken to the yoke. They were as long and
gaunt as their driver, long Jim Baizley; but they
looked equal to any amount of hard work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Them critters of yourn ain&rsquo;t much to look
at, Jim,&rsquo; remarked the boss, as Baizley came &lsquo;geeing&rsquo;
and &lsquo;hawing&rsquo; them into camp toward sundown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The steers swung their hindquarters far apart,
and sagged restively on the yoke, as they came to
a halt. The teamster rolled a loving eye upon
them, and replied,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jest wait till they git yankin&rsquo; onto the logs,
an&rsquo; then see what you think of &rsquo;em!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim Baizley was a smart teamster; and on the
following morning, with his heart set on showing
off his team to the best advantage, he was the first
to get to work hauling. The snow was getting
softer and softer, a warm wind having blown all
night so that there had been no chance for it to
stiffen up. This heightened the general anxiety;
and there was no time lost in following Baizley
to &lsquo;the Ridge,&rsquo; a patch of sloping forest where
a lot of fine timber lay waiting to be hauled out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the Ridge to the Landing it was necessary
to take a new road, which had been already
roughly chopped out. As Baizley with his lean
cattle started out for the Landing with a couple
of huge timbers chained together behind them,
<span class="pb" id="Page_299">299</span>
one of the hands shouted to remind him that he
was the first to go over the new road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look out for slumps, Jim!&rsquo; cried the chopper.
&lsquo;This here snow hain&rsquo;t got no kind of a bottom to
it now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baizley rolled his eyes over the stretch of track
before him, which his load was soon to plough into
picturesque disorder. With a thoughtful gesture,
and very deliberately, he spit a huge quantity of
tobacco-juice over the dull-white, soggy surface
just in front of the oxen, and then said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll look out. Gimme a peevy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grasping the long white pole, shod with a
steel spike at the larger end, he started his team
toward the Landing. Instead of walking beside
his cattle, in the teamster&rsquo;s customary place, he
travelled a few feet in front of their noses; and
from time to time he thrust the pike-pole sharply
into the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be borne in mind that the snow in
these north shore woods lies anywhere from two
to five feet deep. Under such a covering may
lie concealed, not only the firm forest floor, but
dangerous bog-holes, or steep little dry gullies.
Hence the wise precaution which Baizley took of
feeling the way for his oxen. The lack of such
precaution has cost many a careless lumberman
his team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the present case, however,&mdash;so perverse a
witch is chance,&mdash;Baizley&rsquo;s very prudence was the
<span class="pb" id="Page_300">300</span>
well-spring of disaster. His experience was such
as might almost have led him to forswear precautions
for the rest of his natural life&mdash;as a teamster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close behind Baizley&rsquo;s team came another,
driven by Tamin Landry, a little Frenchman from
down the river. <i>Tamang</i>, as the Frenchman was
called by his comrades, had great confidence in
Baizley&rsquo;s skill as a guide. He felt it safe to take
his team wherever Baizley should take his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently Baizley&rsquo;s pike-pole sank deeply into
the snow with sudden and suspicious ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whoa-oa-o!&rsquo; he yelled, rolling his eyes back
upon the steers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The team surged forward till they were almost
upon him, and he rapped them sharply across the
muzzles. Then they stopped, with their heads far
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;W&rsquo;at ze matter?&rsquo; inquired Tamang, skipping
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Big hole here!&rsquo; responded Baizley. He was
prodding the snow near the trunk of a mighty
tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Solid ground furder this way, likely!&rsquo; he continued;
and he gave a vicious prod some two feet
farther out from the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The result was something to startle even a
backwoodsman. The snowy surface rose up suddenly,
with a spluttering, grunting noise, as if an
infant volcano were about breaking into eruption.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">301</div>
<p>&ldquo;Almost thrown off his feet, Baizley sprang to
one side, while the excitable Tamang jumped into
the air with a yell of astonishment. The yoke of
steers swerved wildly to one side, and would have
run away but for their heavy load. Then there
emerged from the snow the hugest and hollowest
of black bears, his long fur thickly blotched with
lumps of his white covering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus painfully and unceremoniously aroused
from his winter sleep, the bear was in a thoroughly
justifiable rage. Perhaps also the pangs of unrealized
hunger added to his fury. He glanced
with small red eyes from side to side, then flung
himself clumsily but swiftly upon the nearest ox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With mad bellowing the team plunged in
among the trees; and in their terror so great was
their strength, that the great timbers they were
hauling danced after them like jackstraws. But
this was not for long. Ere they had gone ten
yards from the road, the ox which the bear had
struck, blind with panic, caught his long horns in
a sapling, and fell forward on his knees. For a
moment his yoke-fellow held him up, then he
collapsed in a limp red-and-white heap, with his
neck broken. And the bear began tearing at him
savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paralyzed and helpless, the other steer sank in
the snow. By this time, however, Baizley and the
Frenchman had recovered their scattered wits and
seized their axes. Baizley&rsquo;s eyes rolled wildly,
<span class="pb" id="Page_302">302</span>
with pity for his team and wrath against the bear.
With the full sweep of his long, wiry arms, he
swung his heavy axe and brought it down upon
the animal&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least, that was Baizley&rsquo;s amiable intention;
but any one who has tried to hit a bear over the
head with an axe knows how difficult a feat it
is to accomplish, unless the bear is asleep. This
bear was very wide-awake indeed; Baizley&rsquo;s pike-pole
had seen to that!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though apparently engrossed with the dead
steer, he had been watching his assailants out of
the corner of his eye. Just as the great axe began
its deadly descent, the beast half rose, and
like a flash threw up his mighty forearm. On
this the axe-handle struck and glanced, and the
weapon flew violently off among the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a desperate exclamation Baizley attempted
to jump away; and at the same moment
the bear brought down his other paw with a stroke
that all Baizley&rsquo;s tried skill as a boxer would not
have availed to parry. But fortunately for the
tall lumberman, his footing gave way. He fell
headlong in the snow, and the stroke of that
armed paw passed harmlessly over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bear dropped forward upon him, but was
at once distracted by a fierce blow on the shoulder
from Landry&rsquo;s axe. With a snort he turned about,
and gave chase to the nimble little Frenchman.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">

<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Tamang came leaping Past with the Bear at His Heels.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Page 303.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">303</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, this was in all respects a most fortunate
diversion. Tamang was so light of foot that the
snow easily upbore him. He found himself able,
without difficulty, to elude his floundering pursuer.
He took a short circuit among the trees,
and headed back toward the team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baizley was now on his feet, and himself
again. He was running to pick up his axe, when
Tamang yelled, &lsquo;No! No! Spear him, spear him
wid ze peevy, Jeem! Spear him wid ze peevy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a good idea, and Baizley realized the
force of it. The steel-shod pike-pole was indeed
a formidable weapon. Grasping it short in both
hands, Baizley sprang upon the logs of his ill-fated
load, and a second later Tamang came leaping
past with the bear at his heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In an instant the plucky Frenchman turned
and faced his pursuer. The bear rose on his hind
legs to seize him, and Baizley&rsquo;s opportunity had
arrived. With all his force he drove the point
of the pike-pole into the brute&rsquo;s body, right under
the foreshoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down came the huge arm, snapping the tough
pole like a splinter; but the steel point had gone
home. The bear fell dead, close beside the dead ox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whilst Tamang, with voluble excitement,
examined the two victims of Baizley&rsquo;s wise precautions,
the latter with taciturn deliberation proceeded
to unyoke the trembling steer from its
ill-starred mate. But from the way his eyes rolled
in their lean sockets, it was easy to see that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_304">304</span>
gaunt lumberman was doing some swift and energetic
thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Now, then, Magnus,&rdquo; cried Queerman, &ldquo;we
look to you. Will it be more about the lumber-camps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Magnus; &ldquo;I shall introduce a
beast of whom none of you have yet said a word.
Yet he is an important beast, and played no small
part in preparing the land of Canaan for the advent
of the children of Israel. My story is&mdash;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;SAVED BY A HORNET&rsquo;S NEST.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I got the story just a few weeks ago, when I
was out fishing on the Rushagornish with Dick
Henderson. Near the shore we came upon a huge
hornets&rsquo; nest suspended beneath a bush. Swayed
by the common impulse of destructiveness, I suggested
that we should set fire to the nest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, indeed,&rsquo; said Dick. &lsquo;If we attack the
nest we deserve to get stung. Mr. Yellow Jacket
is a self-respecting citizen, and will not trouble
you unless you wantonly interfere with him. If
he resents aggression fiercely, we cannot blame
him for that, can we? Besides, a hornets&rsquo; nest
is held sacred among us Hendersons.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to confess,&rsquo; I exclaimed,
&lsquo;that it symbolizes the spirit and temper of your
family?&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_305">305</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not exactly,&rsquo; replied Dick. &lsquo;But it certainly
preserved the connection between flesh and spirit
for our family at a very critical moment. My
Grandfather Henderson owed his life to a nest
of hornets at a time when he, a young man of
twenty-two, was the sole representative of his
line.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trout were not rising, and the rapidly
heating air persuaded to indolence. I stood my
rod up in a bush, threw myself down in a shady
spot, and remarked to Dick that he might as well
tell me about his grandfather. This invitation
elicited the following curious story:&mdash;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;It was during the war of 1812. The battles
of Chrysler&rsquo;s Farm and Chateauguay had not yet
been fought, and the Canadians were in doubt as
to the movements of the two American armies
which were preparing to attack Montreal. They
knew that General Wilkinson was at Sackett&rsquo;s Harbor,
making ready to descend the St. Lawrence;
but in regard to General Hampton, who was advancing
by way of Lake Champlain, information
was much in demand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandfather, James Henderson, who knew
the country between the St. Lawrence and Lake
Champlain, volunteered to get the information.
He had many friends on the American side of the
line, most of whom, as he knew, heartily disapproved
of this unnecessary struggle between the
<span class="pb" id="Page_306">306</span>
United States and England. On these he depended
for help if he should get caught; and he really
gave far too little heed to the nature of the risk
he was running. Yet he took wise precautions,
and played his part with discretion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a ragged-looking horse and a shabby
pedler&rsquo;s wagon, and himself skilfully made up
for the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of a country hawker, he was comparatively
secure from recognition. Indeed, I have
heard him boast that he made sales to some of
his most intimate acquaintances, who never for an
instant dreamed that it was Jim Henderson whom
they were haggling with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All went prosperously until the very end of
the adventure drew near. My grandfather was
returning with the important information that
Hampton&rsquo;s objective point was the mouth of the
Chateauguay River, whence he would cross the
St. Lawrence, and descend upon Montreal from
Lachine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Smith&rsquo;s Corners, a little rudimentary village
about ten miles from the Canadian border,
my grandfather stopped for a bite of dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake Smith, the landlord of the little inn, was
a trusted friend; and to him my grandfather revealed
himself in obedience to a sudden impulse.
It was the first time on the whole journey that
he had given the slightest clew to his true personality.
Well for him that he yielded to this
impulse, else even the friendly hornets&rsquo; nest, to
<span class="pb" id="Page_307">307</span>
which we are coming presently, would not have
availed to save him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake Smith was a stirring fellow, who under
ordinary circumstances would have liked nothing
better than running a spy to earth; but when that
spy was Jim Henderson, the case was different.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandfather had stood his horse and wagon
in on the spacious barn floor, and was having a
wash in a little bedroom opening off the kitchen.
The bedroom door was partly closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly, through the crack of the door, he
caught sight of a small party of American militiamen,
at whose heels followed two huge brindled
mastiffs, or part mastiffs, probably a cross between
mastiff and bloodhound. Henderson, confident
in his disguise, was just slipping on his coat
with the idea of going out and speaking to the
soldiers, when the leader&rsquo;s voice, addressing the
landlord at the kitchen door, arrested him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s that pedler chap that drove in here
a few minutes ago?&rsquo; inquired the officer, puzzled
at seeing no sign of the wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you want of him?&rsquo; inquired the
landlord with an air of interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll show you presently!&rsquo; said the officer.
&lsquo;And we&rsquo;ll want you, too, if we catch you trying
to shelter a spy! Where is he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t shelter no spies,&rsquo; growled Jake Smith
ambiguously; &lsquo;and I&rsquo;d advise you to keep your
jaw for your own men!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_308">308</div>
<p>&ldquo;The officer was about to make an angry reply,
but changed his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That pedler,&rsquo; said he firmly, &lsquo;is a spy; and
it is your duty to assist in his capture. Is he in
this house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Smith knew better than to try to persuade
the soldiers that Henderson had driven
away. He saw they had certain knowledge of
the spy&rsquo;s presence. So he exclaimed:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A spy, is he? Well, I reckon you&rsquo;ve about
got him, then. He&rsquo;s drove his team in on the
barn floor, out of the sun, and most likely&rsquo;&mdash;but
the whole squad were off for the barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To the woods! The cave!&rsquo; hissed Smith toward
the little bedroom; and at the same instant
my grandfather darted from the window, down
behind the tall rows of pole-beans and a leafy bed
of artichokes, and gained the cover of the woods
which touched on the rear edge of the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ran with desperate speed, following at first
a well-beaten cattle-path that led straight into the
woods. But he had small hope of escape. It was
the glimpse he had got of those two great dogs
that filled his soul with dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the troops alone he would have cared
little. He knew he could outrun most men, and
the forest afforded innumerable hiding-places. But
those dogs! With no weapon but his sheath-knife,
he could hardly hope to overcome them without
being himself disabled; and if he were to take
<span class="pb" id="Page_309">309</span>
refuge in a tree, they would just hold him there
till their masters arrived to lead him off to an
ignominious death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandfather concluded, however, that his
only chance for escape lay in fighting the dogs. If
he could kill them before the soldiers came up,
he might possibly get away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to make the most of this poor chance he
must get deep into the woods, and lead the dogs
a long distance ahead of the troops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He understood the sound tactics of dividing
the enemy&rsquo;s forces. He tightened his belt and ran
on, snatching up by the way a stout stick which
some one had intended for a cane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cave of which Smith had spoken lay about
three miles from the village. After following the
cattle-path for perhaps half a mile, my grandfather
turned a little to the right and plunged
into the trackless forest. His long, nimble legs
carried him swiftly over the innumerable obstructions
of the forest floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His ears were strained anxiously to catch the
first deep baying that would tell him the dogs
were on his scent. Every minute that the dreadful
voices delayed was an addition to his little
stock of hopes. If only he could reach the cave,
his chances of victory over the dogs would be
much increased; for the entrance to it was so
small that only one of his assailants would be able
to get in at a time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_310">310</div>
<p>&ldquo;At last, when he had run about two miles, his
breath failed him. He threw himself flat on his
face on a bit of mossy ground beside a brook. As
he lay there gasping, his mouth open, his eyes
shut, suddenly along the resonant ground were
borne to his ears the voices of the dogs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he sprang to his feet he could no longer
hear them; but he knew he must gain more time.
Jumping into the brook he ran several hundred
yards up-stream; then, seizing a long, overhanging
branch, he swung himself well ashore, some
ten feet clear of the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As he once more headed for the cave, he flattered
himself, not without reason, that the dogs
would lose some time before they picked up his
scent again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The baying of the pursuers soon came near
enough to be distinctly heard, and then grew in
volume rapidly. At last it stopped; and he knew
the dogs had reached the brook, and were hunting
for the scent. Before that sinister music rose
again on the stillness of the wilderness air, Henderson
came in sight of the hillside wherein the
cave lay hidden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as he was congratulating himself that he
had now a good chance of escape, a thought occurred
to him that dashed his hopes. &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said
he to himself, &lsquo;the dogs would most likely refuse
to enter the cave!&rsquo; Seeing the smallness of the
entrance, they would no doubt stay baying outside,
<span class="pb" id="Page_311">311</span>
keeping him like a rat in a hole until the
soldiers should come and smoke him out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, he decided to risk it. He could, at
least, block the entrance with stones, and make
some sort of fight at the last; or even there might
be some other exit,&mdash;some fissure in the hill
which he had never explored. At any rate, he
was too much exhausted to run any farther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As he approached the low opening in the hillside
a lot of hornets darted past his ears. Having
a dread of hornets he glanced about nervously,
and imagined at first they were denizens of his
cave. But in a moment he saw the nest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an immense gray globular structure,
hanging from the branch of a small fir-tree, at a
height of about two feet from the ground. It was
not more than five or six feet from the cave, and
almost directly in front of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henderson was a man of resources; and he
appreciated the fighting prowess of a well-stirred
colony of hornets. He decided to enlist the colony
in his defence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hornets were taking no notice of him
whatever, being intent on business of their own.
Henderson took a long piece of string from his
trousers pocket, and in the most delicate fashion
possible made one end fast to the branch which
supported the nest. Then, lying down flat on his
face, he squirmed softly past without getting into
collision with the insects, and crawled into the
<span class="pb" id="Page_312">312</span>
cave, carrying with him the other end of the
string.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once safely inside, his first care was to grope
around for a big stone or two. These he soon
procured, and with their aid the entrance was
blocked. Then he took off his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He laid his ear to the crevices in his barricade.
The dogs were getting so near that he could hear
now the crashing of their heavy forms as they
bounded through the underbrush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holding his coat ready to stop up, if necessary,
the small openings he had left for observation,
he began jerking sharply on the string which
connected him with the hornets&rsquo; nest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could hear the furious buzzing which instantly
arose as the hornets swarmed forth to
resent the disturbance. He could see how the air
grew yellow all about the nest. But it did not
occur to the angry insects to seek for their disturber
in the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henderson jerked again and yet again, and
the enraged swarm grew thicker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this moment the dogs came into view.
Very deadly and inexorable they looked as they
bounded along, heads low down, their dark, muscular
bodies dashing the branches aside and bearing
down the undergrowth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, realizing perhaps that they had run their
prey to earth, they raised their heads and barked,
in a tone very different from that of their baying.
Unfalteringly they dashed straight upon the barricade;
and one of them, as he sprang past, struck
the nest a ruder shock than any that my grandfather&rsquo;s
string had been able to give it.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_313">313</div>
<p>&ldquo;In that same instant the exasperated hornets
were upon the dogs. A sharp chorus arose of
angry and frightened yelpings. Yet for a few
seconds the brave brutes persisted in their efforts
to force an entrance to my grandfather&rsquo;s retreat.
This gave the hornets a fair chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They settled upon the animals&rsquo; eyes and ears
and jaws, till flesh and blood&mdash;even dog flesh and
blood&mdash;could endure the fiery anguish no longer.
Both dogs rolled over and over, burrowing their
noses in the moss, and trying with their paws to
scrape off their bitter assailants. But the contest
was too unequal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently both dogs stuck their tails between
their legs, and darted off in mad panic through
the woods. Gradually their yelpings died away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandfather then and there registered a
vow that he would never again break up a hornets&rsquo;
nest. He slackened the string till it lay
loose and inconspicuous amid the moss, but he
did not exactly care to go out and detach it from
the branch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he lay down and rested, feeling pretty
confident that the soldiers would not find their
way to his retreat now that they were deprived of
the assistance of the dogs. As for the dogs, he
<span class="pb" id="Page_314">314</span>
knew that their noses were pretty well spoiled for
a day or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That night, when he felt quite sure the hornets
had gone to bed, my grandfather crept out
of his refuge, stole softly past his little protectors
without disturbing them to say farewell, and struck
across the forest in the direction of the Canadian
border. A little later the moon got up, and by
her light he made good progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon after daybreak he reached the banks of
the Chateauguay, and about an hour later he fell
in with a scouting-party of the Glengarry Fencibles,
who took him to the headquarters of De
Salaberry, the Canadian commander. As for the
ragged old horse and the pedler&rsquo;s wagon, they
remained at Smith&rsquo;s Corners, a keepsake for Jake
Smith.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Ranolf, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a good enough
yarn to go to bed on. I&rsquo;m as sleepy as a June-bug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this we all discovered that we were in
the same condition as Ranolf. The exhilaration
of the run down the Toledi, and the hard strain
of the passage across Temiscouata, had tired us
through and through. How delicious were our
blankets that night at D&eacute;tour du Lac!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_315">315</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">THE LAST CAMP-FIRE.</span></h2>
<p>We got away from D&eacute;tour du Lac in the early
morning, and reached the outlet, the head of the
Madawaska River, after a brisk paddle of some
eight miles. The run down the Madawaska was
swift and easy,&mdash;a rapid current and a clear channel.
What more could canoemen wish? Late in
the afternoon we pitched tent on a woody hill half
a mile above Edmundston. To signalize our return
to civilization we visited the hotel and post-office,
and then returned to camp for tea. The
fire blazed right merrily that night, and to ward
off melancholy thoughts we told stories as usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said Stranion, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve saved for this last
night in camp the one that I count choicest of all
my yarns. The scene of it lies on those very
waters which we have lately passed through!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name?&rdquo; demanded I, sharpening my pencil
with a business air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just&mdash;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;INDIAN DEVILS,&rsquo;</h3>
<p>replied Stranion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a scorching noon in mid-July of 1885.
Dear old H&mdash;&mdash; and I were in camp on the upper
<span class="pb" id="Page_316">316</span>
waters of the Squatook, not far below the mouth
of Beardsley Brook. How H&mdash;&mdash; loved to get
away from his professorial dignity and freely unbend
in the woods! He used to swear he would
never again put on a starched collar. But his big
American university keeps him prim enough now!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had called a halt for dinner and siesta in
a little sandy cove, where the river eddied listlessly.
It was a hollow between high banks, down
which drew a soft breeze as through a funnel, and
the deep grass fringing the tiny beach was densely
shadowed by a tangle of vines and branches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our birch canoe was behind us, her resined
sides well shaded from the heat. At the water&rsquo;s
edge flickered the remnants of our fire, paled and
browbeaten by the steady downpour of sunshine.
The stream itself, for a wonder grown drowsy,
idled over its pebbly bed with a sleep-inducing
murmur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we were thus half idling and dreaming,
I was startled wide awake by the grating of a
paddle on a line of gravelly shoals above the
point. A moment more and a birch canoe swept
into view, and drew up at our landing-place. The
crew, two youngish-looking Indians, having lifted
their craft out of the water, stalked silently up
the beach and paused before us, leaning on their
paddles. With a non-committal grunt they accepted
some proffered tobacco, glanced over our
baggage, eyed greedily the bright nickel-plating
<span class="pb" id="Page_317">317</span>
on our trout-rods, and murmured something in
Melicete which I failed to comprehend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The professor, somewhat annoyed at this intrusion,
blinked sleepily at them for a while, and
then proceeded to sort and stow away his latest
acquired specimens, amongst which were some
splendid bits of pyrites, glittering richly in the
sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of our visitors was not unknown to me.
He was a certain Joe Tobin, of ill repute, hailing
from Francis Village. The other was an older
looking man, with high cheek-bones and little,
pig-like, half-shut eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The appearance of neither had any attraction
for me, but the Indian with the pig-like eyes I
found particularly distasteful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These eyes grew intent at once, as they caught
the yellow gleam of the pyrites; but their owner
preserved his air of stoical indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Approaching the professor&rsquo;s side, he sought a
closer examination; but the professor was not propitiatory.
He dumped the ore into his specimen-box
before the Indian could touch it; and shifting
the box deeper into the shade, he took his seat
upon it. The box was plainly heavy, and a gleam
of interest crept into the cunning eyes of Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gold, mebbe?&rsquo; he suggested persuasively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To which the professor, facetiously grumpy,
answered, &lsquo;Yes, all gold! Fools&rsquo; gold!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this a most greedy glance passed furtively
<span class="pb" id="Page_318">318</span>
between the Indians, and it flashed upon me that
by the barbaric ear &lsquo;Fools&rsquo; gold&rsquo; might be misinterpreted
to &lsquo;Full of gold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave the rash professor a warning look,
which Joe intercepted. I then proceeded to explain
what was meant by &lsquo;Fools&rsquo; gold,&rsquo; and declared
that the things in the professor&rsquo;s box were
valueless bits of rock, which we had picked up
chiefly out of curiosity. This statement, however,
as I could see by our visitors&rsquo; faces, was at once
regarded as a cunning and cautious lie to conceal
the vast value of our treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whereabouts you get um?&rsquo; queried Joe
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; answered the professor, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s lots of
it floating round Mud Lake and Beardsley Brook.&rsquo;
He took a lovely cluster of crystals out of his
pocket, and laughed to see how the Indians&rsquo; eyes
stuck out with deluded avarice. I felt angry at
his nonsense, for one of our visitors was an out-and-out
ruffian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few moments, after a series of low grunts,
which baffled my ear completely, though I was acquainted
with the Melicete tongue, the Indians
turned to go, saying in explanation of their sudden
departure, &lsquo;Sugar Loaf &rsquo;fore sundown, mebbe.&rsquo;
I took the precaution to display, at this juncture, a
double-barrelled breech-loader, into which I slipped
a couple of buck-shot cartridges; and as I nodded
them a bland farewell, I said in Melicete, &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll be
<span class="pb" id="Page_319">319</span>
late when you get to Sugar Loaf.&rsquo; The start they
gave, on hearing me speak their own language,
confirmed my suspicions, and they paddled off in
haste without more words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sooner were they well out of sight than I
made ready with all speed for our own departure;
nor did I neglect to upbraid the professor for his
rashness. At first he pooh-poohed my apprehension,
declaring that it was &lsquo;fun to fool the greedy
Hottentots;&rsquo; but when I explained my grounds
for alarm, he condescended to treat them with
some respect. He warmed up, indeed, and made
haste, so that we were once more darting along
with the racing current before the Indians had
been gone above ten minutes; but I could see
that he had adopted my suspicions mainly for the
sake of an added excitement. The professor&rsquo;s
class-room afforded too little scope for such an adventurous
spirit, and he was beginning to crave
the relish of a spice of peril. With his dainty
rifle just to his hand, he was soon plying a fervent
and effective paddle, while his sharp eyes kept a
lookout which I knew very little would evade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our design was to press so closely upon the
rascals&rsquo; heels that any plot they might agree upon
should not find time to mature. We knew they
would never calculate upon our following them so
promptly; still less would they dream of the speed
that we were making. In a fair race we flattered
ourselves that we could beat most Indians, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_320">320</span>
we rather counted on overtaking and passing this
couple before they could accomplish aught against
us. There was one point in the stream, however,
which I remembered with misgivings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three or four miles ahead of us were the rapids
which, you remember, we had such fun with
a few days ago. I suggested to H&mdash;&mdash; that there,
if anywhere, those Indians would lie in wait for
us, knowing that our hands would be well occupied
in navigating the canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those five miles soon slipped by. As we shot
down the roaring channel we saw, in the reach
beyond the last turmoil, a canoe thrust in among
the alders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah-h-h!&rsquo; exclaimed the professor, in a tone
of deepening conviction; and he shifted his grip
upon his rifle. An instant more and we were in
the surges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just then I saw the professor start, half raising
his rifle to the shoulder; but the canoe was
taking all my attention, and I dared not follow
his glance to shoreward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our delicate craft seemed to wallow down the
roaring trough. The stream was much heavier
than we found it the other day, I can tell you.
At the foot of the first <i>chute</i> a great thin-crested
ripple slapped over us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had understood the professor&rsquo;s gesture; and,
as we plunged down the next leap, I chuckled to
myself, &lsquo;Sold this time!&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_321">321</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like a bird, the true little craft took the
plunge. One more blinding dash of spray, a shivering
pause, and, darting forward arrow-like, she
dipped to the last and steepest descent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this instant, from the bank overhead, came
a spurt of blue smoke and a report, followed by
a twinge in my left shoulder. Another report,
scarcely audible amid the falls&rsquo; thunder, and
cleaving the last great ripple, we swept into gentler
currents. Crack! crack! crack! went the
professor&rsquo;s little rifle, as he fired over his shoulder
at the place where the smoke-puffs clung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Push on, before they can load again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dropping my paddle, as we passed their
empty canoe, I put two charges of buck-shot
through her birchen sides. Then, satisfied that
the mending of this breach would keep our enemy
wholesomely occupied for some time, we
pushed forward swiftly in grim triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few miles farther on I stopped, and informed
the professor that I was wounded. At
this he turned about in such sudden concern that
he barely missed upsetting the canoe; but he presently
remarked, &lsquo;By the healthy vigor you&rsquo;ve
displayed in running away the last half hour, I
don&rsquo;t imagine the wound can be serious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On examination we found that a bullet had
nicked the top of my shoulder, though not so
deeply but that cold water and some strips of
sticking-plaster went far toward giving relief from
<span class="pb" id="Page_322">322</span>
pain. But the muscular action of paddling caused
the scratch to become inflamed; and so, when at
about four in the afternoon we swept out on the
smooth waters of the lake, I gave up the stern
paddle to the professor, and played invalid a while
in the bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A light breeze, to which we hoisted our sail,
took us pleasantly down the lake, and about half-past
six we landed near the outlet. We tented
just where Camp de Squatook stood a few days
ago. Under the lulling influence of a supper of
fresh fried trout, the savor of which mixed deliciously
with the wholesome scent of the pines, we
concluded that perhaps by this time our enemies
would have given up the pursuit, disgusted by
their past failure and the damage done to their
canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, we resolved to take thorough
precautions, lest our adversaries should cross the
head of the lake and come upon us by night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We built a huge fire so that it shone upon
the landing-place, and lighted up every way of
approach by water. The tent stood out in the
full glare. To the rear and a little to one side,
beyond the limits of the grove, in the densest
part of the thicket, we fixed ourselves a snug and
secret couch, whence we could command a view
of the whole surroundings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close by we arranged a pile of bark, with
kindlings and dry balsamic pine-chips, such as
<span class="pb" id="Page_323">323</span>
we could urge into a sudden blaze in case of any
emergency. Immediately behind us was the water,
and from that side we felt that we were safe so
long as that glare of firelight could be maintained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We fixed up the camp to look natural and secure,
hung our wet clothes to dry on the <i>cheep lahquah-gan</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
closed the tent-door for the night to
keep out the mosquitoes, and retired, not dissatisfied,
to our covert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a dark and almost starless night, with
a soft, rainy wind soughing in the pine-tops, and
making the &lsquo;Big Squatook&rsquo; wash restlessly all
down her pebbled beaches. As we drew our
weapons close to us, and stretched ourselves luxuriously
in our blankets, we could not forbear a
low laugh at a certain relish the situation held
for us. The professor, however, suddenly became
serious; and he declared, &lsquo;But this lark&rsquo;s in the
soberest kind of earnest, anyway; and we mustn&rsquo;t
be letting ourselves tumble to sleep!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My shoulder gave an admonitory twinge, and
I cordially acquiesced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just then a far-off howl of hideous laughter,
ending in a sob of distress, came down the night
wind, making our flesh creep uncomfortably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is that what the Indians call Glusk&acirc;p&rsquo;s Hunting-dogs?&rsquo;
whispered the professor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_324">324</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not by any means!&rsquo; I answered under my
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, it ought to be,&rsquo; returned the professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I replied that the voice, in my opinion, came
from the dangerous Northern panther, or &lsquo;Indian
devil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These animals, I went on to explain for
H&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s comfort, were growing yearly more numerous
in the Squatook regions, owing to the fact
that the caribou, their favorite prey, were being
driven hither from the south counties and from
Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just then the cry was repeated, this time a
little nearer; and the professor began to inquire
whether it was Indian or Indian devil about which
we should have most call to concern ourselves.
His hope, but half-expressed, was plainly for a
&lsquo;whack at both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assured him that so long as the Indian devil
kept up his serenading we had little need to be
troubled; but should the scent of our fried trout
be blown to his nostrils, and divert his mind from
thoughts of love to war, then would it behoove
us to be circumspect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we talked on thus in an undertone which
was half-drowned by the washing of the waves,
the panther&rsquo;s cry was heard much nearer than
before; and it was not again repeated. This put
us sharply on our guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hour after hour passed, till we began to find
<span class="pb" id="Page_325">325</span>
it hard to keep awake. Only the weirdness of the
place, the strange noises which stole towards us
from the depths of the forest, dying out within
a radius of a couple of hundred yards from the
firelight, together with our anxiety concerning
the movements of the panther, kept us from falling
asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The professor told some stories of the skill
of Western Indians in creeping upon guarded
posts, and I retorted with examples of the cunning
and ferocity of these Northern Indian devils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once we were started into renewed vigilance
by what seemed like a scratching or clawing on
the bark of some tree near at hand; but we heard
no more of it. When, as near as we could guess,
it must have been well past midnight, we began
to be concerned at the lowness of our fire. It had
fallen to a mere red glow, lighting up a circle
of not more than twenty yards around the camp.
As for our covert, it was now sunk in the outer
darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We considered the needs and risks of replenishing
the fire, and concluded that the risks were
so far greater than the needs, that our better plan
was to stay where we were till morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If our enemies were upon our tracks, then for
either of us to approach the light would be to betray
our stratagem, besides furnishing a fair and
convenient target; while we felt tolerably sure
that the panther was in some not distant tree,
<span class="pb" id="Page_326">326</span>
waiting to drop, according to his pleasant custom,
upon any one that should come within his reach.
These considerations made us once more satisfactorily
wakeful, and with straining our sight
through the blackness our nerves got painfully on
the stretch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bird stirred in the twigs above us, and the
professor whispered, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there was a trailing rustle of the dry
leaves near our feet; and, with a sharp click and
a jump of the pulse, I brought my gun to full
cock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But two little points of green light close together,
which met my eyes for an instant, told me
that it was only a wood-mouse which we heard
scurrying away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The professor whispered, &lsquo;What was it disturbed
the mouse? He seemed in a hurry about
something when he ran against us that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was a point, and we weighed it. We
were just about to hazard some guess, allowing for
an owl, or polecat, or other night prowler, when
the professor gripped my arm sharply, and whispered,
&lsquo;Look!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just on the outermost verge of the dim circle,
I could detect a human figure, creeping like a
snake toward the rear corner of the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Shall we shoot&mdash;wound him?&rsquo; whispered
the professor breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No; wait!&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;Look out for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_327">327</span>
other fellow. We&rsquo;ll capture them both and take
away their guns.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The words were scarce out of my mouth when
there was a sort of mad rush, and a struggle, apparently
close beside us, followed by an agonized
shriek. We sprang to our feet in horror, and at
once set our little beacon ablaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, not twenty yards off, beneath a tree,
lay a twitching human form. Upon his breast
crouched the Indian devil, with its jaws buried in
his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a cry we sprang to the rescue, and the
beast, half-cowed by the sudden blaze, seemed at
first disposed to slink off; but, changing its purpose,
it set its claws deeper into its prey, and
faced us with an angry snarl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The grove all around was now as bright as
day. The professor rushed straight upon the
beast; but for myself, turning at the moment to
draw my sheath-knife, I caught sight of the other
Indian, whom we had forgotten, in the act of deliberately
drawing a bead upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stood erect, close by the tent, his pig-eyed
countenance lighted up by the red glare. I had
just time to drop flat upon the ground, ere a report
rang out, and a bullet went <i>spat</i> into a tree-trunk
close above me. I returned the shot at
once from where I lay, and my assailant fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without pausing to notice more, I turned to
my companion&rsquo;s assistance. He had just fired one
<span class="pb" id="Page_328">328</span>
charge into the animal, and then drawn his knife,
afraid to fire a second time lest his shot should
strike the Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I reached his side the Indian devil sprang;
but the ball had struck a vital spot, and snarling
madly it fell together in a heap, while again and
yet again went the professor&rsquo;s knife between its
shoulders right up to the hilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the dead brute stiffened out its sinewy
length, we dragged it one side and made haste
to examine its victim. The poor wretch proved
to be Tobin; and we found him stark dead,
his throat most hideously mangled, and his neck
broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sickened at the sight we turned away. The
other Indian we found still lying where he had
fallen, with his right arm badly shattered by my
heavy charge of buck-shot. After brightening up
the fire we proceeded to dress his wounds. At
this work we had small skill, and dawn broke before
we got it accomplished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, digging with our paddles a grave in a
sandy spot on the shore, we buried the Indian
devil&rsquo;s victim, and set out with our sullen prisoner
for the settlements. Paddling almost night
and day, we reached D&eacute;tour du Lac, and there we
delivered up our captive to the combined cares of
the doctor and the village constable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we afterwards learned, the doctor&rsquo;s care
proved effectual; but that of the constable was so
<span class="pb" id="Page_329">329</span>
much less so, that the villain escaped before he
could be brought to justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Truly you keep your good wine for the last,
Stranion,&rdquo; said Ranolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can Sam do as well, I wonder?&rdquo; inquired
Queerman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Sam positively. &ldquo;But
he can give you something humorsome, at least,
to relieve this tragic strain. It&rsquo;s about a bear, of
course. I&rsquo;m very glad my bears hold out so well.
This story is called,&mdash;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;BRUIN&rsquo;S BOXING-MATCH.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;It was a dreamy, sun-drenched September
afternoon. The wide, shallow river was rippling
with a mellow noise over its golden pebbles.
Back from the river, upon both banks, the yellow
grain-fields and blue-green patches of turnips
slanted gently to the foot of the wooded hills.
A little distance down stream stood two horses,
fetlock-deep in the water, drinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near the top of the bank, where the gravel
had thinned off into yellow sand, and the sand
was beginning to bristle with the scrubby bushes
of the sand-plum, lay the trunk of an ancient
oak-tree. In the effort to split this gnarled and
seasoned timber, Jake Simmons and I were expending
the utmost of our energies. Our axes
had proved unequal to the enterprise, so we had
<span class="pb" id="Page_330">330</span>
been at last compelled to call in the aid of a heavy
mall and hardwood wedges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the axes we had accomplished a slight
split in one end of the prostrate giant. An axe-blade
held this open while we inserted a hardwood
wedge, which we drove home with repeated
blows of the mall till the crack was widened,
whereupon, of course, the axe dropped out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mall&mdash;a huge, long-handled mallet, so
heavy as to require both hands to wield it&mdash;was
made of the sawed-off end of a small oak log, and
was bound around with two hoops of wrought iron
to keep it from splitting. This implement was
wielded by Jake, with a skill born of years in the
backwoods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly, as Jake was delivering a tremendous
blow on the head of the wedge, the mall
flew off its handle, and pounded down the bank,
making the sand and gravel fly in a way that
bore eloquent witness to Jake&rsquo;s vigor. The sinewy
old woodsman toppled over, and, losing his
balance, sat down in a thicket of sand-plums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I laughed, and so did Jake; but our
temperate mirth quieted down, and Jake, picking
himself up out of the sand-plums, went to re-capture
the errant mall. As he set it down on the
timber, and proceeded to refit the handle to it, he
was all at once quite overcome with merriment.
He laughed and laughed, not loudly, but with
convulsive inward spasms, till I began to feel indignant
<span class="pb" id="Page_331">331</span>
at him. When mirth is not contagious, it
is always exasperating. Presently he sat down
on the log and gasped, holding his sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be such an old fool, Jake,&rsquo; said I
rudely; at which he began to laugh again, with
the intolerable relish of one who holds the monopoly
of a joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything so excruciatingly funny,&rsquo;
I grumbled, &lsquo;in the head flying off of an old mall,
and a long-legged old idiot sitting down hard
in the sand-plum patch. That mall might just
as well as not have hit me on the head, and
maybe you&rsquo;d have called <i>that</i> the best joke of the
season.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bless your sober soul!&rsquo; answered Jake, &lsquo;it
ain&rsquo;t that I&rsquo;m laughing at.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not going to give him the satisfaction of
asking him for his story, so I proceeded to fix a
new wedge, and hammer it in with my axe. Jake
was too full of his reminiscence to be chilled by
my apparent lack of interest. Presently he drew
out a short pipe, filled it with tobacco, and remarked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When I picked up that there mall-head, I
was reminded of something I saw once up in the
Madawaska woods that struck me as just about
the funniest I ever heard tell of. I &rsquo;most died
laughing over it at the time, and whenever I think
of it even now it breaks me all up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he paused and eyed me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_332">332</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t believe <i>you&rsquo;d</i> see anything funny
in it, because you didn&rsquo;t see it,&rsquo; he continued in
his slow and drawling tones &lsquo;so I reckon I won&rsquo;t
bother telling you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he picked up the handle of the mall as
if to resume work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still kept silence, resolved not to ask for the
story. Jake was full of anecdotes picked up in
the lumbering-camps; and though he was a good
workman, he would gladly stop any time to smoke
his pipe, or to tell a story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he kept chuckling over his own thoughts
until I couldn&rsquo;t do a stroke of work. I saw I had
to give in, and I surrendered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, go along and let&rsquo;s have it!&rsquo; said I, dropping
the axe, and seating myself on the log in an
attitude of most inviting attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This encouragement was what Jake was waiting
for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Did you ever see a bear box?&rsquo; he inquired.
I had seen some performances of that sort; but
as Jake took it for granted I hadn&rsquo;t, and didn&rsquo;t
wait for a reply, I refrained from saying so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, a bear can box <i>some</i>, now I tell you.
But I&rsquo;ve seen one clean knocked out by an old
mall without a handle, just like this one here;
and there wasn&rsquo;t any man at the end of it either.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here Jake paused to indulge in a prolonged
chuckle as the scene unrolled itself anew before
his mind&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_333">333</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It happened this way: A couple of us were
splitting slabs in the Madawaska woods along in
the fall, when, all of a sudden, the head of the
mall flew off, as this &rsquo;ere one did. Bill, however,&mdash;Bill
Goodin was the name of the fellow with
me,&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t so lucky as you were in getting out
of the way. The mall struck a tree, glanced, and
took Bill on the side of the knee. It keeled him
over so he couldn&rsquo;t do any more work that day,
and I had to help him back to the camp. Before
we left, I took a bit of codline out of my pocket,
ran it through the eye, and strung the mall up
to a branch so it would be easier to find when I
wanted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was maybe a week before I went for that
mall,&mdash;a little more than a week, I should say;
and then, it being of a Sunday afternoon, when
there was no work to do, and Bill&rsquo;s leg being so
much better that he could hobble alone, he and
I thought we&rsquo;d stroll over to where we&rsquo;d been
splitting, and bring the mall in to camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When we got pretty near the place, and
could see through the trees the mall hanging
there where we had left it, Bill all of a sudden
grabbed me sharp by the arm, and whispered,
&ldquo;Keep still!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said I, under my breath,
looking all around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Use your eyes if you&rsquo;ve got any,&rdquo; said he;
and I stared through the branches in the direction
<span class="pb" id="Page_334">334</span>
he was looking. But there was a trunk in the
way. As soon as I moved my head a bit, I saw
what he was watching. There was a fine young
bear sitting back on his haunches, and looking at
the mall as if he didn&rsquo;t know what to make of it.
Probably that bear had once been hurt in a trap,
and so had grown suspicious. That there mall
hanging from the limb of a tree was something
different from anything he&rsquo;d ever seen before.
Wondering what he was going to do, we crept
a little nearer, without makin&rsquo; any noise, and
crouched down behind a spruce bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The bear was maybe a couple of yards from
the mall, and watching it as if he thought it
might get down any moment and come at him.
A little gust of wind came through the trees and
set the mall swinging a bit. He didn&rsquo;t like this,
and backed off a few feet. The mall swung some
more, and he drew off still farther; and as soon as
it was quite still again, he sidled around it at a
prudent distance, and investigated it from the
other side of the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;The blame fool is scared of it,&rdquo; whispered
Bill scornfully; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s fling a rock at him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, knowing bears pretty well;
&ldquo;let&rsquo;s wait and see what he&rsquo;s going to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, when the mall had been pretty still
for a minute or two, the bear appeared to make up
his mind it didn&rsquo;t amount to much after all; he
came right close up to it as bold as you like, and
pawed it kind of inquiringly. The mall swung
away; and being hung short, it came back quick,
and took the bear a smart rap on the nose.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">

<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Bruin&rsquo;s Boxing Match.</span>&mdash;Page 335.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_335">335</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bill and I both snickered, but the bear didn&rsquo;t
hear us. He was mad right off, and with a snort
he hit the mall a pretty good cuff; back it came
like greased lightning, and took him again square
on the snout with a whack that must have made
him just see stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bill and I could hardly hold ourselves; but
even if we had laughed right out I don&rsquo;t believe
that bear would have noticed us, he was so mad.
You know a bear&rsquo;s snout is mighty tender. Well,
he grunted and snorted, and rooted around in the
leaves a bit, and then went back at the mall as if
he was just going to knock it into the other side
of to-morrow. He stood up to it, and he did hit
it so hard that it seemed to disappear for half a
second. It swung right over the limb; and, while
he was looking for it, it came down on the top
of his head. Great Scott! how he roared! And
then, scratching his head with one paw, he went
at it again with the other, and hit it just the same
way he&rsquo;d hit it before. I tell you, Bill and I pretty
near burst as we saw that mall fly over the limb
again and come down on the top of his head just
like the first time. You&rsquo;d have thought it would
have cracked his skull; but a bear&rsquo;s head is as
hard as they make them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This time the bear, after rubbing his head
<span class="pb" id="Page_336">336</span>
and his snout, and rooting some more in the
leaves, sat back and seemed to consider. In a
second or two he went up to the mall, and tried
to take hold of it with one paw; of course it
slipped right away, and you&rsquo;d have thought it was
alive to see the sharp way it dodged back and
caught him again on the nose. It wasn&rsquo;t much
of a whack this time, but that nose was tender
enough then! And the bear got desperate. He
grabbed for the mall with both paws; and that
way, of course, he got it. With one pull he
snapped the codline, and the victory was his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;After tumbling the mall about for a while,
trying to chew it and claw it to pieces, and getting
nothing to show for his labor, he appeared
absolutely disgusted. He sat down and glared at
the bit of iron-bound oak lying so innocent in the
leaves, and kept feeling at his snout in a puzzled
sort of way. Then all of a sudden he gave it
up as a bad job, and ambled off into the woods
in a hurry as if he had just remembered something.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">This story had called forth a running commentary
of appreciative chuckling. When it ended,
every one was in a merry humor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; remarked Queerman, &ldquo;that I, too,
have kept one of my best stories for the last. At
least, it seems the best to me; and I hope you fellows
won&rsquo;t think it the worst, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_337">337</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tell you about that after we hear it,&rdquo;
said Magnus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here goes,&rdquo; continued Queerman. &ldquo;My
title is&mdash;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;THE RAFT RIVALS.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The last log of Th&eacute;riault&rsquo;s &lsquo;drive,&rsquo; not counting
a few sticks hopelessly &lsquo;hung up&rsquo; on far-off
Squatook Shoals, had been captured in the amber
eddies of the Lower Basin below Grand Falls,
and had been safely pinned into the great raft
which was just about to start on its leisurely voyage
down the river to the shrieking saws of Fredericton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This &rsquo;ere&rsquo;s as purty a site fur pinnin&rsquo; up a raft
as ever I sot eyes on!&rdquo; remarked Ben Smithers,
thrusting his hand into his gray-blue homespun
breeches for his fig of &lsquo;black-jack.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben was sitting on a rock near the water&rsquo;s
edge. No one made answer to his remark, which
was perhaps regarded as too obvious to call for
comment. Presently a large black dog, as if unwilling
that any grain of wisdom should drop from
his master&rsquo;s lips unheeded, thrust his head into
Ben&rsquo;s lap, and uttered a short bark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For perhaps half an hour Ben Smithers and
his fellows sat on the shore or lounged about the
raft, smoking and whittling, and not one complained
of the delay. The rafts which Th&eacute;riault
had already despatched down the river, each requiring
<span class="pb" id="Page_338">338</span>
two or three hands to navigate it through
the rapids, had thinned the numbers of the drive
down to not more than ten men, all of whom were
bound for Fredericton on this very raft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently one of the hands took the pipe from
his mouth, tapped it gently on a log to remove the
ashes, and remarked, &lsquo;Here they be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wagon was descending the precipitous road
which led from the unseen village to the beach.
An apprehensive looking horse between the shafts
hung back warily upon the breeching, and a red-shirted
lumberman clung doggedly to one of the
wheels. At the anxious horse&rsquo;s head trudged a
boy; and behind or beside the wagon, as pleased
her fancy, there danced a five-year-old child, her
long yellow hair and bright pink frock making her
look like some strange kind of butterfly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As their eyes fell on the little creature a grin
of rough tenderness flashed out on the faces of
the gang. Little Mame Th&eacute;riault, who came with
this wagon-load of supplies for the gang, and who
was to accompany the raft down the river, at once
became the pet of the drive. Her father, a young
widower, took her wherever it was possible, and
her baby hands were dispensers of gentleness
throughout the roughest gangs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only Jake, the dog, refused his tribute of
homage. Jake&rsquo;s heart was sore within him, for he
was jealous of little Mame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake was a dog among ten thousand. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_339">339</span>
possessed countless accomplishments, and was
ever athirst to learn more. His intelligence was
such that &lsquo;cute as Jake&rsquo; had become a current
phrase of compliment with Ben Smithers and his
comrades. Wholly devoted to his master, he
was at the same time hail-fellow-well-met with
all hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until Mame&rsquo;s appearance on the scene, Jake
had reigned without a rival. Now it was quite
different. The hands, though as respectful as
ever, seemed strangely forgetful of his presence
at times; and with Ben, when Mame was by, his
place had become secondary, and all his eager affection
seemed to go as a matter of course. Ordinarily
Jake would have liked well to make a
playmate of Mame; but as it was&mdash;never!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole party had got aboard, and the raft
was shoved off into the current. In the middle
of the structure stood a rough, temporary
shanty of hemlock slabs, with an elbow of rusted
stovepipe projecting through the roof. Within
this shelter the cook presided, and two or three
bunks gave accommodation for part of the gang.
The others, including of course Mame and her
father, looked to more luxurious sleeping quarters
in the settlements along shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mame was enchanted with her surroundings,&mdash;with
the shores slipping smoothly past, with
the ripples washing up between the logs, with
the dashes of spray over the windward edges of
<span class="pb" id="Page_340">340</span>
the raft, with the steersmen tugging on the great
sweeps, and last, but by no means least, with the
wide sheets of glossy gingerbread which the cook
in his little house was producing for her particular
gratification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had never before experienced the delight
of a raft voyage. She skipped from side to side
on her swift but unsteady little feet, and all hands
were kept anxiously alert to prevent her from falling
into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several times she made playful advances to
the big dog, throwing herself down on the logs
beside him, and scattering her yellow curls over
his black and crinkly coat; but Jake, after a reluctant
wagging of his tail, as if to indicate that
his action was based on principle, and not on any
ill-will toward herself, invariably got up and made
a reserved withdrawal to some remoter corner of
the raft. Th&eacute;riault noticed this, as he had done
on previous occasions, and it seemed to vex him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> see what Jake&rsquo;s got agin the child
that he won&rsquo;t let her play with him,&rsquo; he remarked
half-crossly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I guess it&rsquo;s &rsquo;cause he ain&rsquo;t no ways used
ter children, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s kinder afeared o&rsquo; breakin&rsquo;
her,&rsquo; Ben Smithers responded laughingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake had caught the irritation in the boss&rsquo;s
tone, and had vaguely comprehended it. Upon
the boss his resentment was tending to concentrate
itself. He could harbor no real ill-feeling
<span class="pb" id="Page_341">341</span>
toward the child, but upon Luke Th&eacute;riault he
seemed to lay the whole blame for his dethronement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toward noon the breeze died down, and the
heat grew fierce. The yellow-pink gum began to
soften and trickle on the sunny sides of the logs,
and great fragrant beads of balsam to ooze out
from every axe-wound. The gang clustered, as
far as possible, under the insufficient shade of the
cook-house, in loosely sprawling attitudes,&mdash;hats
off and shirt-bosoms thrown wide open. Jake got
down on the lowermost tier of logs, and lay panting
in a couple of inches of water, surrounded
by floating bits of bark and iridescent patches of
balsam scum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for Mame, her pink frock by this time was
pretty well bedraggled, and frock and hands alike
smeared and blackened with balsam. Her sturdy
little copper-toed boots were water-soaked. The
heat had a suppressing effect even upon her, and
she spent much of the time in Ben&rsquo;s lap in the
shade of the cook-house; but now and then she
would rouse herself to renewed excursions, and
torment the raftsmen&rsquo;s weather-beaten breasts with
fresh alarms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The river at this part of its course was full of
shoals and cross-currents, calling for a skilful pilot;
and Th&eacute;riault kept sweltering about the open raft
rather than trust the steering to less responsible
hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_342">342</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just as the cook, with parboiled countenance,
came to the door of his den to announce the
dinner, Mame had run to Jake&rsquo;s retreat, and
crawled down upon the panting animal&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This contributed not at all to Jake&rsquo;s coolness,
and he felt seriously disturbed by the intrusion.
Slipping from under as gently as he could, he
moved away in vexation, and Mame rolled in the
shallow water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She picked herself up, wet and whimpering;
and Th&eacute;riault, who happened to be standing close
by, spoke angrily to the dog, and gave him a sharp
kick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Jake this was a new and startling experience.
He could hardly resist the temptation to
spring upon his insulter, and pin him to the raft.
Too wise for this, however, he merely stiffened
himself to his full height with a sudden, deep
growl, and rolled a significant side glance upon
his assailant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boss was astonished. At the same time
he was just a little startled, which made him still
more angry, and he shouted,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you snarl at me, you brute, or I&rsquo;ll kick
you off o&rsquo; the raft!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben Smithers interposed. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t kick him
agin, boss!&rsquo; he exclaimed. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean no disrespec&rsquo;,
but Jake ain&rsquo;t never had no kicks an&rsquo; cuffs,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d ruther he <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> have none, &rsquo;less he desarves
&rsquo;em. He don&rsquo;t know now what you kicked
<span class="pb" id="Page_343">343</span>
him fur, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s only protestin&rsquo;. He wouldn&rsquo;t
hurt a hair o&rsquo; yer head; an&rsquo; ez fur Mame, howsomever
he may keep outen her way in this &rsquo;ere heat,
I&rsquo;d jest like ter see anythin&rsquo; try ter tech her onkind
when Jake war &rsquo;round. You&rsquo;d see then who
was Mame&rsquo;s friend!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;During Ben&rsquo;s expostulation Th&eacute;riault had
cooled down. He laughed a little awkwardly,
and acknowledged that he &lsquo;hadn&rsquo;t no call, under
the circumstances, to kick the dog;&rsquo; but at the
same time it was with no glance of affection that
he eyed Jake during dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the meal was over he cautioned Mame
so severely that the child began to look upon the
dog as a bloodthirsty monster, and thereafter Jake
was persecuted no more with her attentions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor dog was none the happier on this
account. Unheeded by his master, who through
most of the afternoon kept nursing the wearied
child in his lap, the poor animal lay grieving on
a far-off corner of the raft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Late in the afternoon the raft entered the succession
of rapids lying below the mouth of the
Munquauk. There are few shoals here, but the
steering is difficult by reason of turbulent water
and cross currents. About this time, than which
none could be more inopportune, little Mame
woke to new life, and resumed her perilous flittings
about the raft. The men who were not
needed at the sweeps were kept busy in pursuit
<span class="pb" id="Page_344">344</span>
of her. The swift motion, the tremblings of the
raft, the tumult of the currents,&mdash;these all enchanted
and exhilarated the child. Like a golden-crowned
fairy, she balanced tiptoe upon the upper
logs, clapping her stained little hands, her hair
blown all about her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly forsaking Ben&rsquo;s company, she started
toward her father, where he stood at the stern
of the raft, directing the steersmen. The father
reached out his hands to her, laughing. She was
within three or four feet of him, but she chose
to tantalize him a little. She darted to one side,
pausing on the very edge of the raft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this moment the timbers lurched under a
heavy swell. Mame lost her balance, and with
a shrill cry of terror she fell into the pitching
current.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mingled groan and prayer went up all over
the raft; and Th&eacute;riault and one of the hands, a big
woodsman named Vandine, plunged in to the rescue.
Ben Smithers was not a swimmer, and he
could only stand and wring his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th&eacute;riault and the other who had sprung in
were both strong swimmers; but a narrow surface
current had seized Mame&rsquo;s small form, and whirled
it far away from the raft, while the heavy bodies
of the men, grasped by the under-current, were
forced in a different direction.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig16">

<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Slowly battling with the Waves, Jake and His Precious Burden drew Near the Raft.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Page 346.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_345">345</div>
<p>&ldquo;Th&eacute;riault&rsquo;s face grew ghastly and drawn as
he saw the distance between himself and his child
slowly widening. His desperate efforts could not
carry him away from the raft, and he marked that
Vandine was no more successful than he. A choking
spasm tightened about his throat, and he gave
a keen, sobbing cry of anguish as he saw the little
pink-frocked form go under for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then a great black body shot into the air
above his head, and landed with a splash far beyond
him. &lsquo;Jake!&rsquo; he thought instantly; and a
thankful sigh went up from his heart. Now he
began to care once more about keeping his own
head above water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake was late in noticing the catastrophe. He
had been deep in a sullen and heavy sleep. When
the cries awoke him he yawned, and then mounted
a log to take a survey of the situation. In a second
or two he caught sight of the pink frock tossing
in the waves, and of the little hands flung up
in appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His instantaneous and tremendous rush carried
him far out from the raft, and then his pure
Newfoundland blood made him master of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little he cared for the tumult and the white-capped
waves! His sinewy shoulders and broad-webbed
feet drove him straight through cross-current
and eddy to where the child had sunk.
When she came up he was within five feet of her,
and with a quick plunge he caught her by the
shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_346">346</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now Jake&rsquo;s difficulties began. In quieter
waters he would have found no trouble, but here
he was unable to choose his hold. The men saw
him let go of the child&rsquo;s shoulder, snatch a mouthful
of the frock, and start for the raft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this position Mame&rsquo;s head passed under
water, and all hands were in a panic lest she
should drown before Jake could get her in. But
the dog dropped his burden yet again, seized the
little one by the upper part of the arm, and in this
position was able to hold her head clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was a trying position. To maintain it,
Jake had to swim high, and to set his teeth with
pitiless firmness into the child&rsquo;s tender arm. The
wave-crests slapped ceaselessly in his face, half-choking
him, and strangling Mame&rsquo;s cries every
instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th&eacute;riault and Vandine were by this time so
exhausted as to be quite powerless, and were with
difficulty pulled back upon the raft. There stood
all hands straining their gaze upon the gallant
dog&rsquo;s progress. Ben Smithers waited, with a pike-pole,
on the very edge of the timbers, ready to
hook the steel into Mame&rsquo;s frock, and lift her
aboard the moment Jake got within reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slowly battling with the waves, Jake and his
precious burden drew near the raft. Already Ben
Smithers was reaching out his pike-pole. Suddenly
there was a crash, and the raft stopped
short, quivering, while the waves poured over its
<span class="pb" id="Page_347">347</span>
upper edge. The timbers of the farther inshore
corner had run aground and wedged fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a moment of bewildering suspense,
while Jake and his charge were swept swiftly past
the hands stretched out to save them. Then the
raft broke into two parts, and the larger outside
portion swung out across the main current and
drove straight down upon the swimmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a cry the raftsmen threw themselves flat
on the logs, grasped at the dog, and succeeded in
snatching the now silent child to a place of safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake had just got his fore-paws over the logs
when the mass drove down upon his body. His
head went back under the water; and Ben, who
had a firm grip in the long hair of his pet&rsquo;s fore
shoulders, was himself well nigh dragged overboard.
Two of his comrades, throwing themselves
on the logs beside him, plunged down their arms
into the boiling foam and got hold of the helpless
dog, and, almost lifeless, Jake was laid upon the
raft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feebly wagging his tail, the noble fellow lay
with his head in Ben Smithers&rsquo;s lap, while the
strength returned to his sinews, and the breath
found its way again to the depths of his laboring
lungs. As the gang gathered about, and a babel
arose of praise and sympathy, Jake seemed to
appreciate the tribute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the boss had seen his child put safely
and warmly to bed in the cook&rsquo;s bunk, he rushed
<span class="pb" id="Page_348">348</span>
forward and threw himself down beside Ben Smithers.
He embraced Jake&rsquo;s dripping body, burying
his face in the wet black ringlets, and speaking
words of gratitude as fast as he could utter them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this, though passionately sincere, and to
Ben highly satisfactory and appropriate, was to
Jake a plain annoyance. He knew nothing of the
delights of reconcilement, or of the beauty of an
effective situation, and he failed to respond. He
simply didn&rsquo;t like Th&eacute;riault. He endured the endearments
for a little, gazing straight into Ben&rsquo;s
face with a piteous appeal. Then he staggered to
his feet, dragged himself around to the other side
of his master, and thrust his big wet head under
the shield of Ben&rsquo;s ample arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th&eacute;riault laughed good-naturedly and rose to
his feet. &lsquo;Poor Jake!&rsquo; he murmured, &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;
to persecute him with no more thanks, seein&rsquo;
he don&rsquo;t greatly enjoy it. But I can tell <i>you</i>, Ben
Smithers, what a mistake I made this morning, an&rsquo;
how it sticks in my crop now to think on it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here the boss thrust out his hand, and Ben
Smithers grasped it cordially. It was a general
understanding that the boss thus apologized to
Jake for his behavior in the morning, and that
thus Jake duly accepted the apology. Jake was
expected to understand the proceeding as the gang
did, and to abide by it. No atom of surprise was
felt, therefore, when, after the lapse of a day, it
became plain that Jake and the boss were on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_349">349</span>
best of terms, with Mame in her proper place of
idolized and caressed subordination.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;That Jake was not all unworthy to sit with
Jeff and Dan,&rdquo; said I, as Queerman ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ranolf; &ldquo;he was a prince among
dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this we told no more stories. I, who had
all the records in charge, made my report, giving
statistics as to fish caught, miles travelled, localities
of camps, and so forth, as well as the names
and tellers of all the stories. The report proving
satisfactory, we sang &ldquo;Home, Sweet Home&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Auld Lang Syne,&rdquo; standing around the camp-fire.
